        systems, but an indispensable component. Many operating systems directly use and even
        require some degree of 3D rendering hardware. Even in the increasingly important mobile
        computing space, 3D graphics hardware is a standard feature of all but the lowest power
        devices.</p><p>Understanding how to make the most of that hardware is a difficult challenge, particularly
        for someone new to graphics and rendering.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e30"></a>Why Read This Book?</h2></div></div></div><p>There are many physical books for teaching graphics. There are many more online
            repositories of knowledge, in the form of wikis, blogs, tutorials, and forums. So what
            does this book offer that others do not?</p><p>Programmability. Virtually all of the aforementioned sources instruct beginners using
            something called <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">fixed functionality.</span>&#8221;</span> This represents configurations in
            older graphics processors that define how a particular rendering operation will proceed.
            It is generally considered easiest to teach neophyte graphics programmers using the
            fixed function pipeline.</p><p>This is considered true because it is easy to get something to happen with fixed
            functionality. It's simpler to make pictures that look like something real. The fixed
            function pipeline is like training wheels for a bicycle.</p><p>There are downsides to this approach. First, much of what is learned with this
            approach must be inevitably abandoned when the user encounters a graphics problem that
            must be solved with programmability. Programmability wipes out almost all of the fixed
            function pipeline, so the knowledge does not easily transfer.</p><p>A more insidious problem is that the fixed function pipeline can give the
                <span class="emphasis"><em>illusion</em></span> of knowledge. A user can think they understand what
            they are doing, but they're really just copy-and-pasting code around. Programming thus
            becomes akin to magical rituals: you put certain bits of code before other bits, and
            everything seems to work.</p><p>This makes debugging nightmarish. Because the user never really understood what the
            code does, the user is unable to diagnose what a particular problem could possibly mean.
            And without that ability, debugging becomes a series of random guesses as to what the
            problem is.</p><p>By contrast, you cannot use a programmable system successfully without first
            understanding it. Confronting programmable graphics hardware means confronting issues
            that fixed function materials often gloss over. This may mean a slower start overall,
            but when you finally get to the end, you truly <span class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> how everything
            works.</p><p>Another problem is that, even if you truly understand the fixed function pipeline, it
            limits how you think about solving problems. Because of its inflexibility, it focuses
            your mind along certain problem solving possibilities and away from others. It
            encourages you to think of textures as pictures; vertex data as texture coordinates,
            colors, or positions; and the like. By its very nature, it limits creativity and problem
            solving.</p><p>Lastly, even on mobile systems, fixed functionality is generally not available in the
            graphics hardware. Programmability is the order of the day for most graphics hardware,
            and this will only become more true in the future.</p><p>What this book offers is beginner-level instruction on what many consider to be an
            advanced concept. It teaches programmable rendering for beginning graphics programmers,
            from the ground up.</p><p>This book also covers some important material that is often neglected or otherwise
            relegated to <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">advanced</span>&#8221;</span> concepts. These concepts are not truly advanced,
            but they are often ignored by most introductory material because they do not work with
            the fixed function pipeline.</p><p>This book is first and foremost about learning how to be a graphics programmer.
            Therefore, whenever it is possible and practical, this book will present material in a
            way that encourages the reader to examine what graphics hardware can do in new and
            interesting ways. A good graphics programmer sees the graphics hardware as a set of
            tools to fulfill their needs, and this book tries to encourage this kind of
            thinking.</p><p>One thing this book is not, however, is a book on graphics APIs. While it does use
            OpenGL and out of necessity teach rendering concepts in terms of OpenGL, it is not truly
            a book that is <span class="emphasis"><em>about</em></span> OpenGL. It is not the purpose of this book to
            teach you all of the ins and outs of the OpenGL API.There will be parts of OpenGL
            functionality that are not dealt with because they are not relevant to any of the
            lessons that this book teaches. If you already know graphics and are in need of a book
            that teaches modern OpenGL programming, this is not it. It may be useful to you in that
            capacity, but that is not this book's main thrust.</p><p>This book is intended to teach you how to be a graphics programmer. It is not aimed at
            any particular graphics field; it is designed to cover most of the basics of 3D
            rendering. So if you want to be a game developer, a CAD program designer, do some
            computer visualization, or any number of things, this book can still be an asset for
            you.</p><p>This does not mean that it covers everything there is about 3D graphics. Hardly. It
            tries to provide a sound foundation for your further exploration in whatever field of 3D
            graphics you are interested in.</p><p>One topic this book does not cover in depth is optimization. The reason for this is
            simply that serious optimization is an advanced topic. Optimizations can often be
            platform-specific, different for different kinds of hardware. They can also be
            API-specific, as some APIs have different optimization needs. Optimizations may be
            mentioned here and there, but it is simply too complex of a subject for a beginning
            graphics programmer. There is a chapter in the appendix covering optimization
            opportunities, but it only provides a fairly high-level look.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="index.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center">&nbsp;</td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="About Need.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Learning Modern 3D Graphics Programming&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;What You Need</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
