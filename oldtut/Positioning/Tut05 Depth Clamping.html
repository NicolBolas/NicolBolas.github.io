Sure, it keeps the hardware from dividing by zero, which I
            guess is important, but it looks really bad. It's showing the inside of an object that
            has no insides. Plus, you can also see that it has no backside (since we're doing face
            culling); you can see right through to the object behind it.</p><p>If computer graphics is an elaborate illusion, then clipping utterly
                <span class="emphasis"><em>shatters</em></span> this illusion. It's a big, giant hole that screams,
                    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>this is fake!</em></span></span>&#8221;</span> as loud as possible to the
            user. What can we do about this?</p><p>The most common technique is to simply not allow it. That is, know how close objects
            are getting to the near clipping plane (ie: the camera) and do not let them get close
            enough to clip.</p><p>And while this can <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">function</span>&#8221;</span> as a solution, it is not exactly good. It
            limits what you can do with objects and so forth.</p><p>A more reasonable mechanism is <em class="glossterm">depth clamping</em>. What this does
            is turn off camera near/far plane clipping altogether. Instead, the depth for these
            fragments are clamped to the [-1, 1] range in NDC space.</p><p>We can see this in the <span class="propername">Depth Clamping</span> tutorial.
            This tutorial is identical to the vertex clipping one, except that the
                <code class="function">keyboard</code> function has changed as follows:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e5689"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;5.12.&nbsp;Depth Clamping On/Off</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-keyword">void</span> keyboard(<span class="code-keyword">unsigned</span> <span class="code-keyword">char</span> key, <span class="code-keyword">int</span> x, <span class="code-keyword">int</span> y)

            glEnable(GL_DEPTH_CLAMP);
        
        bDepthClampingActive = !bDepthClampingActive;
        <span class="code-keyword">break</span>;
    }
}</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>When you press the space bar (ASCII code 32), the code will toggle depth clamping,
            with the
                <code class="function">glEnable</code>/<code class="function">glDisable</code>(<code class="literal">GL_DEPTH_CLAMP</code>)
            calls. It will start with depth clamping off, since that is the OpenGL default.</p><p>When you run the tutorial, you will see what we saw in the last one; pressing the
            space bar shows this:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e5707"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;5.8.&nbsp;Depth Clamping</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Depth%20Clamping.png" alt="Depth Clamping"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>This looks correct; it appears as if all of our problems are solved.</p><p>Appearances can be deceiving. Let's see what happens if you move the other object
            forward, so that the two intersect like in the earlier part of the tutorial:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e5717"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;5.9.&nbsp;Depth Clamp With Overlap</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Double%20Depth%20Clamping.png" alt="Depth Clamp With Overlap"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Oops. Part of it looks right, just not the part where the depth is being clamped.
            What's going on?</p><p>Well, recall what depth clamping does; it makes fragment depth values outside of the
            range be clamped to within the range. So depth values smaller than depth zNear become
            depth zNear, and values larger than depth zFar become depth zFar.</p><p>Therefore, when you go to render the second object, some of the clamped fragments from
            the first are there. So the incoming fragment from the new object has a depth of 0, and
            some of the values from the depth buffer also have a depth of 0. Since our depth test is
                <code class="literal">GL_LESS</code>, the incoming 0 is not less than the depth buffer's 0, so
            the part of the second object does not get rendered. This is pretty much the opposite of
            where we started: previous rendered objects are in front of newer ones. We could change it to <code class="literal">GL_LEQUAL</code>, but that only gets
            us to <span class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> where we started.</p><p>So a word of warning: be careful with depth clamping when you have overlapping objects
            near the planes. Similar problems happen with the far plane, though backface culling can
            be a help in some cases.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>We defined depth clamping as, in part, turning off clipping against the camera
                near and far planes. If you're wondering what happens when you have depth clamping,
                which turns off clipping, and a clip-space W &lt;= 0, it's simple. In camera space,
                near and far clipping is represented as turning a pyramid into a frustum: cutting
                off the top and bottom. If near/far clipping is not active, then the frustum becomes
                a pyramid. The other 4 clipping planes are still fully in effect. Clip-space
                vertices with a W of less than 0 are all outside of the boundary of any of the other
                four clipping planes.</p><p>The only clip-space point with a W of 0 that is within
                this volume is the homogeneous origin point: (0, 0, 0, 0); everything else will be
                clipped. And a triangle made from three positions that all are at the same position would have no area; it would therefore generate no fragments anyway. It can be safely eliminated before the perspective divide.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tut05 Boundaries and Clipping.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Tutorial 05.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut05 In Review.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Boundaries and Clipping&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;In Review</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
