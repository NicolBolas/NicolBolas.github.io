        objects.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e8021"></a>Gimbal Lock</h2></div></div></div><p>Remember a few tutorials back, when we said that a rotation matrix is not a rotation
            matrix at all, that it is an orientation matrix? We also said that forgetting this can
            come back to bite you. Well, here's likely the most common way.</p><p>Normally, when dealing with orienting an object like a plane or spaceship in 3D space,
            you want to orient it based on 3 rotations about the 3 main axes. The obvious way to do
            this is with a series of 3 rotations. This means that the program stores 3 angles, and
            you generate a rotation matrix by creating 3 rotation matrices based on these angles and
            concatenating them. Indeed, the 3 angles often have special names, based on common
            flight terminology: yaw, pitch, and roll.</p><p>Pitch is the rotation that raises or lowers the front of the object. Yaw is the
            rotation that turns the object left and right. Roll is the rotation that spins it around
            the direction of motion. These terms neatly duck the question of what the axes
            technically are; they are defined in terms of semantic axes (front, left, direction of
            motion, etc), rather than a specific model space. So in one model space, roll might be a
            rotation about the X axis, but in another, it might be a rotation about the Z
            axis.</p><p>One of the first problems you will note is that the order you apply these rotations
            matter. As previously stated, a rotation matrix is an <span class="emphasis"><em>orientation</em></span>
            transform. Each transform defines a new coordinate system, and the next transform is
            based on an object in the <span class="emphasis"><em>new</em></span> space. For example, if we apply the
            roll first, we have now changed what the axis for the subsequent yaw is.</p><p>You can use any order that you like, so long as you understand what these angles mean.
            If you apply the roll first, your yaw and pitch must be in terms of the new roll
            coordinate system, and not the original coordinate system. That is, a change that is
            intended to only affect the roll of the final space may need yaw or pitch changes to
            allow it to have the same apparent orientation (except for the new roll, of
            course).</p><p>But there is a far more insidious problem lurking in here. And this problem happens
            anytime you compute a final rotation from a series of 3 rotations about axes
            perpendicular to each other.</p><p>The tutorial project <span class="propername">Gimbal Lock</span> illustrates this
            problem. Because the problem was first diagnosed with a physical device called a <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal" target="_top">gimbal</a>, the problem has
            become known as <em class="glossterm">gimbal lock.</em></p><p>A gimbal is a pivoted support that provides the ability to rotate in one axis. A
            gimbal can be mounted within another gimbal. The Gimbal Lock project has a set of 3
            square gimbals, each with a pivot axis that is perpendicular to the other two. This
            effectively mimics the common yaw/pitch/roll angle setup.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e8055"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;8.1.&nbsp;Gimbal Lock Project</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Three%20Gimbal%20Array.png" alt="Gimbal Lock Project"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>You can control the orientation of each gimbal separately. The <span class="keycap"><strong>W</strong></span> and
                <span class="keycap"><strong>S</strong></span> keys control the outer gimbal, the <span class="keycap"><strong>A</strong></span> and
                <span class="keycap"><strong>D</strong></span> keys control the middle gimbal, and the <span class="keycap"><strong>Q</strong></span> and
                <span class="keycap"><strong>E</strong></span> keys control the inner gimbal. If you just want to see (and
            affect) the orientation of the ship, press the <span class="keycap"><strong>SpaceBar</strong></span> to toggle
            drawing the gimbal rings.</p><p>The first thing you discover when attempting to use the gimbals to orient the ship is
            that the yaw, pitch, and roll controls of the gimbal change each time you move one of
            them. That is, when the gimbal arrangement is in the original position, the outer gimbal
            controls the pitch. But if you move the middle gimbal, it no longer controls
                <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> the pitch. Orienting the ship is very unintuitive.</p><p>The bigger is what happens when two of the gimbals are parallel with one
            another:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e8091"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;8.2.&nbsp;Parallel Gimbals</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="In%20Gimbal%20Lock.png" alt="Parallel Gimbals"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Recall that the purpose of the three gimbals is to be able to adjust one of the three
            angles and orient the object in a particular direction. In a flight-simulation game, the
            player would have controls that would change their yaw, pitch, and roll. However, look
            at this picture.</p><p>Given the controls of these gimbals, can you cause the object to pitch up and down?
            That is, move its nose up and down from where it is currently? Only slightly; you can
            use the middle gimbal, which has a bit of pitch rotation. But that is not much.</p><p>The reason we do not have as much freedom to orient the object is because the outer
            and inner gimbals are now rotating about the same axis. This means you really only have
            two gimbals to manipulate in order to orient the red gimbal. And 3D orientation cannot
            be fully controlled with only 2 axial rotations, with only 2 gimbals.</p><p>When gimbals are in such a position, you have what is known as <em class="glossterm">gimbal
                lock</em>; you have locked one of the gimbals to another, and now both cause
            the same effect.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8108"></a>Rendering</h3></div></div></div><p>Before we find a solution to the problem, let's review the code. Most of it is
                nothing you have not seen elsewhere, so this will be quick.</p><p>There is no explicit camera matrix set up for this example; it is too simple for
                that. The three gimbals are loaded from mesh files as we saw in our last tutorial.
                They are built to fit into the above array. The ship is also from a mesh
                file.</p><p>The rendering function looks like this:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e8117"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;8.1.&nbsp;Gimbal Lock Display Code</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-keyword">void</span> display()

                enough away to be comfortably visible. From there, the three gimbals are drawn, with
                their appropriate rotations. Since each rotation applies to the previous one, the
                final orientation is given to the last gimbal.</p><p>The <code class="function">DrawGimbal</code> function does some rotations of its own, but
                this is just to position the gimbals properly in the array. The gimbals are given a
                color programmatically, which is the 3rd parameter to
                    <code class="function">DrawGimbal.</code></p><p>After building up the rotation matrix, we draw the ship. We use a scale to make it
                reasonably large, and then rotate it so that it points in the correct direction
                relative to the final gimbal. In model space, the ship faces the +Z axis, but the
                gimbal faces the +Y axis. So we needed a change of coordinate system.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tut07 Glossary.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Positioning.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut08 Quaternions.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Glossary&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Quaternions</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
