                        mean. Coordinate systems have a dimensionality (the number of coordinates),
                        an basis vector for each of the dimensions, and an origin position. A
                        coordinate system of 3 dimensions therefore is defined by 3 vectors and a
                        position. The X, Y and Z coordinates in that coordinate system refer to the
                        value you get when you multiply the X, Y, Z values into the X, Y, and Z
                        axes, then add the origin position to those values.</p></dd><dt>basis vector</dt><dd><p>One of the vectors that define a coordinate system. The basis vectors of a
                        coordinate system do not have to be orthogonal or of unit length.</p></dd><dt>transformation</dt><dd><p>The process of moving objects defined in one space to be defined in
                        another space.</p></dd><dt>model space</dt><dd><p>The space that a particular model is expected to be in. Vertex data stored
                        in buffer objects is expected to be in model space.</p></dd><dt>translation transform</dt><dd><p>A transform between two spaces, where the origin of the spaces are not in
                        the same location. This causes objects to shift as they are transformed
                        between the two spaces.</p></dd><dt>identity matrix</dt><dd><p>The matrix I such that the following is true: <span class="mathphrase">MI = M</span>, for any matrix M. Identity matrices only exist for square
                        matrices (a matrix with the same number of columns and rows). An identity
                        matrix consists of a matrix with ones along the diagonal from the top-left
                        to the lower-right, and zeros everywhere else.</p></dd><dt>scale transform</dt><dd><p>A transform between two spaces where the axis vectors of the source space
                        are longer or shorter than the corresponding axis vectors in the destination
                        space. This causes objects to stretch or shrink along the axes as they are
                        transformed between the two spaces.</p></dd><dt>scale inversion</dt><dd><p>Performing a scale by a negative value. This is perfectly allowed, though
                        it can change the winding order of triangles, depending on the axis being
                        scaled.</p></dd><dt>orthogonal</dt><dd><p>Two vectors are orthogonal if they are perpendicular to each other. Three
                        vectors are othogonal if each vector is perpendicular to the other
                        two.</p></dd><dt>rotation transform, orientation transform</dt><dd><p>A transform between two spaces, where the axis vectors of the two spaces
                        are not pointed in the same direction, but the angle between the axis
                        vectors stay the same. This cause a reorientation of objects as they are
                        transformed from the initial space to the destination space.</p></dd><dt>hierarchical model</dt><dd><p>Models can be conceptually composed of multiple independent pieces in a
                        hierarchy. The space of each component of that hierarchy is stored relative
                        to its parent in the hierarchy.</p></dd><dt>node</dt><dd><p>A single model space transform within a hierarchy of model transforms. The
                        node's transform is stored relative to the transform of the node beneath it,
                        called the parent. Nodes can have a single parent node and multiple child
                        nodes; the child nodes' transforms are relative to this node's space.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tut06 In Review.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Tutorial 06.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tutorial 07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">In Review&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;World in Motion</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
