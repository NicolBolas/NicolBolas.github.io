In terms of our
            previous definition of a coordinate system, this means that our basis vectors are
            getting shorter or longer.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e6198"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;6.4.&nbsp;Coordinate System Scaling in 2D</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="ScaleTransform.svg" alt="Coordinate System Scaling in 2D"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Scaling can be uniform, which means each basis vector is scaled by the same value. A
            non-uniform scale means that each basis can get a different scale or none at all.</p><p>Uniform scales are used to allow objects in model space to have different units from
            the units used in camera space. For example, a modeller may have generated the model in
            inches, but the world uses centimeters. This will require applying a uniform scale to
            all of these models to compensate for this. This scale should be 2.54, which is the
            conversion factor from inches to centimeters.</p><p>Note that scaling always happens relative to the origin of the space being
            scaled.</p><p>Recall how we defined the way coordinate systems generate a position, based on the
            basis vectors and origin point:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="CoordinateEquation.svg"></div></div><p>If you are increasing or decreasing the length of the basis vectors, this is the same
            as multiplying those basis vectors by the new length. So we can re-express this equation
            as follows:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="ScaledCoordEquation.svg"></div></div><p>Since scalar-vector multiplication is both associative and commutative, we can
            multiply the scales directly into the coordinate values to achieve the same effect. So a
            scaled space can be reexpressed as simply multiplying the input coordinate
            values.</p><p>This is easy enough to do in GLSL, if you pass a vector uniform containing the scale
            values. But that's just not complicated enough. Obviously, we need to get matrices
            involved, but how?</p><p>This gets a bit technical, in terms of how a matrix multiplication works. But look
            back at the identity matrix:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="IdentityMatrix.svg"></div></div><p>This matrix selects each coordinate in turn from the vector it is being multiplied
            into. Each row is multiplied with the column of the vector; all of the zeros remove the
            components of the vector that we do not want. The 1 value of each row multiplies into
            the component we do want, thus selecting it. This produces the identity result: the
            vector we started with.</p><p>We can see that, if the ones were some other value, we would get a scaled version of
            the original vector, depending on which ones were changed. Thus, a scaling
            transformation matrix looks like this:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e6236"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;6.4.&nbsp;Scaling Transformation Matrix</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="ScaleMatrix.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>You may start to see a pattern emerging here, something that begins to suggest why
            matrices are very, very useful. I will not spoil it for you yet though.</p><p>The tutorial project <span class="propername">Scale</span> will display 5 objects
            at various scales. The objects are all at the same Z distance from the camera, so the
            only size difference between the objects is the scale effects applied to them. The
            object in the center is unscaled; each of the other objects has a scale function of some
            kind applied to them.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e6249"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;6.5.&nbsp;Scale Project</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Scales.png" alt="Scale Project"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Other than the way the tutorial builds its matrices, there is no difference between
            this tutorial project and the previous one. The matrix building code works as
            follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">glm::mat4 ConstructMatrix(<span class="code-keyword">float</span> fElapsedTime)
{
    glm::vec3 theScale = CalcScale(fElapsedTime);
    glm::mat4 theMat(<span class="code-number">1.0f</span>);
    theMat[<span class="code-number">0</span>].x = theScale.x;
    theMat[<span class="code-number">1</span>].y = theScale.y;
    theMat[<span class="code-number">2</span>].z = theScale.z;
    theMat[<span class="code-number">3</span>] = glm::vec4(offset, <span class="code-number">1.0f</span>);
    
    <span class="code-keyword">return</span> theMat;
}</pre><p>As before, the scale is supplied by a number of scale functions, depending on which
            instance is being rendered. The scale is stored in the columns of the identity matrix.
            Then the translation portion of the matrix is filled in.</p><p>The <code class="varname">offset</code> variable is also a member of the
                <code class="classname">Instance</code> object. Unlike the last tutorial, the offset is a
            fixed value. We will discuss the ramifications of applying multiple transforms later;
            suffice it to say, this currently works.</p><p>Scaling is only slightly more complicated than translation.</p><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Perspective and Scaling</b></p><p>The way we construct a scale transformation matrix may seem familiar to you. Back
                in Tutorial 4, the perspective transformation involved a frustum scale value. This
                was used to make up for the fact that our projection defined a specific location for
                the plane of projection and camera eye point. Using this frustum scale, we could
                give the appearance of having a larger or smaller viewing size. Indeed, we later
                used this to define the aspect ratio as well as the field of view, using the
                function defined earlier in this tutorial.</p><p>This frustum scale was ultimately nothing more than a scale factor applied the X
                and Y positions. When we constructed the perspective matrix, we used the frustum
                scale as a uniform scaling in the X and Y dimensions. The aspect ratio compensation
                code was nothing more than applying a <span class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>uniform scale.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e6281"></a>Inversion and Winding Order</h3></div></div></div><p>Scales can be theoretically negative, or even 0. A scale of 0 causes the basis
                vector in that direction to become 0 entirely. An basis vector with no length means
                that a dimension has effectively been lost. The resulting transform squashes
                everything in that direction down to the origin. A 3D space becomes a 2D space (or
                1D or 0D, depending on how many axes were scaled).</p><p>A negative scale changes the direction of an axis. This causes vertices
                transformed with this scale to flip across the origin in that axis's direction. This
                is called an <em class="glossterm">inversion</em>. This can have certain unintended
                consequences. In particular, it can change the winding order of vertices.</p><p>Back in <a class="link" href="Tutorial 04.html#tut04_face_culling" title="Face Culling">Tutorial 4</a>, we introduced the
                ability to cull triangles based on the order in which the vertices appeared in
                window space. Depending on which axis you negate, relative to camera space, an
                inversion can flip the expected winding order of vertices. Thus, triangles that
                were, in model space, forward-facing now in camera space are backwards-facing. And
                vice-versa.</p><p>Negative scaling can have other problems as well. This is not to say that
                inversions cannot be used, but they should be used with care.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tut06 Translation.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Tutorial 06.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut06 Rotation.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Translation&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Rotation</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
