            we're rendering:</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Overlap%20No%20Depth.png"></div></div><p>If the smaller object is truly behind the larger one, why is it being rendered on top
            of the larger one? Well, to answer that question, we need to remember what OpenGL
            is.</p><p>The OpenGL specification defines a rasterization-based renderer. Rasterizers offer
            great opportunities for optimizations and hardware implementation, and using them
            provides great power to the programmer. However, they're very stupid. A rasterizer is
            basically just a triangle drawer. Vertex shaders tell it what vertex positions are, and
            fragment shaders tell it what colors to put within that triangle. But no matter how
            fancy, a rasterization-based render is just drawing triangles.</p><p>That's fine in general because rasterizers are very fast. They are very good at
            drawing triangles.</p><p>But rasterizers do exactly and only what the user says. They draw each triangle
                <span class="emphasis"><em>in the order given</em></span>. This means that, if there is overlap
            between multiple triangles in window space, the triangle that is rendered last will be
            the one that is seen.</p><p>This problem is called <em class="glossterm">hidden surface elimination.</em></p><p>The first thing you might think of when solving this problem is to simply render the
            most distant objects first. This is called <em class="glossterm">depth sorting.</em> As you
            might imagine, this <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">solution</span>&#8221;</span> scales incredibly poorly. Doing it for each
            triangle is prohibitive, particularly with scenes with millions of triangles.</p><p>And the worst part is that even if you put in all the effort, it does not actually
            work. Not all the time at any rate. Many trivial cases can be solved via depth sorting,
            but non-trivial cases have real problems. You can have an arrangement of 3 triangles
            where each overlaps the other, such that there simply is no order you can render them in
            to achieve the right effect.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e5266"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;5.2.&nbsp;Three Overlapping Triangles</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="ThreeTriangleOverlap.svg" alt="Three Overlapping Triangles"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Even worse, it does nothing for inter-penetrating triangles; that is, triangles that
            pass through each other in 3D space (as opposed to just from the perspective of the
            camera).</p><p>Depth sorting is not going to cut it; clearly, we need something better.</p><p>One solution might be to tag fragments with the distance from the viewer. Then, if a
            fragment that is about to be written has a farther distance (ie: the fragment is behind
            what was already drawn), we simply do not write that fragment to the output image. That
            way, if you draw a triangle behind other triangles, the fragment distances that were
            already written will be closer to the camera than the fragment distances of the new
            triangle. And thus, the particular fragments of that triangle will not be drawn. And
            since this works at the fragment level, it will work just as well for intersecting
            triangles or the 3 triangle arrangement depicted above.</p><p>The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">tag</span>&#8221;</span> is the window-space Z value. You may recall from <a class="link" href="../Basics/Intro Graphics and Rendering.html#tut00_window_space" title="Window Transformation">the introduction</a> that the window-space Z
            position of a fragment ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 is the closest and 1 is the
            farthest.</p><p>Colors output from the fragment shader are output into the color image buffer.
            Therefore it naturally follows that depth values would be stored in a <em class="glossterm">depth
                buffer</em> (also called a <em class="glossterm">z buffer</em>, because it stores
            Z values). The depth buffer is an image that is the same size as the main color buffer,
            that stores depth values as pixels rather than colors. Where a color is a 4-component
            vector, a depth is just a single floating-point value.</p><p>Like the color buffer, the depth buffer for the main window is created automatically
            by OpenGL when OpenGL is initialized. OpenGL can even be created without a depth buffer.
            Since FreeGLUT takes care of initializing OpenGL for us, we tell it in the standard
            initialization code to create OpenGL with a depth buffer.</p><p>Writing the depth is not enough. The suggested idea requires stopping the fragment
            from writing anything if the current depth at that location is in front of this
            fragment's depth. This is called the <em class="glossterm">depth test.</em> In OpenGL, the
            test does not have to be in any particular direction; any of the typical numerical
            relation operator (greater than, less than, etc) will work fine. If the test passes,
            then the fragment's outputs (both color and depth) will be written to their appropriate
            buffer. If it fails, then they will not.</p><p>To activate depth testing, we must call
                <code class="function">glEnable</code>(<code class="literal">GL_DEPTH_TEST</code>); the corresponding
                <code class="function">glDisable</code> call will cause depth testing to cease. After
            activating testing, we need to call <code class="function">glDepthFunc</code> to set the relation
            of the depth test. When the test is true, the incoming fragment is written.</p><p>The test functions can be <code class="literal">GL_ALWAYS</code> (always write the fragment),
                <code class="literal">GL_NEVER</code> (no fragments are written), <code class="literal">GL_LESS</code>,
                <code class="literal">GL_GREATER</code>, <code class="literal">GL_LEQUAL</code> (&lt;=),
                <code class="literal">GL_GEQUAL</code> (&gt;=), <code class="literal">GL_EQUAL</code>, or
                <code class="literal">GL_NOTEQUAL</code>. The test function puts the incoming fragment's depth
            on the left of the equation and on the right is the depth from the depth buffer. So
            GL_LESS means that, when the incoming fragment's depth is less than the depth from the
            depth buffer, the incoming fragment is written.</p><p>With the fragment depth being something that is part of a fragment's output, you might
            imagine that this is something you have to compute in a fragment shader. You certainly
            can, but the fragment's depth is normally just the window-space Z coordinate of the
            fragment. This is computed automatically when the X and Y are computed.</p><p>Using the window-space Z value as the fragment's output depth is so common that, if
            you do not deliberately write a depth value from the fragment shader, this value will be
            used by default.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e5345"></a>Depth and the Viewport</h3></div></div></div><p>Speaking of window coordinates, there is one more issue we need to deal with when
                dealing with depth. The <code class="function">glViewport</code> function defines the
                transform between normalized device coordinates (the range [-1, 1]) to window
                coordinates. But <code class="function">glViewport</code> only defines the transform for the
                X and Y coordinates of the NDC-space vertex positions.</p><p>The window-space Z coordinate ranges from [0, 1]; the transformation from NDC's
                [-1, 1] range is defined with the <code class="function">glDepthRange</code> function. This
                function takes 2 floating-point parameters: the <em class="glossterm">range zNear</em>
                and the <em class="glossterm">range zFar</em>. These values are in window-space; they
                define a simple linear mapping from NDC space to window space. So if zNear is 0.5
                and zFar is 1.0, NDC values of -1 will map to 0.5 and values of 1 will result in
                1.0.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Do not confuse the range zNear/zFar with the <span class="emphasis"><em>camera</em></span>
                    zNear/zFar used in the perspective projection matrix computation.</p></div><p>The range zNear can be greater than the range zFar; if it is, then the
                window-space values will be reversed, in terms of what constitutes closest or
                farthest from the viewer.</p><p>Earlier, it was said that the window-space Z value of 0 is closest and 1 is
                farthest. However, if our clip-space Z values were negated, the depth of 1 would be
                closest to the view and the depth of 0 would be farthest. Yet, if we flip the
                direction of the depth test (GL_LESS to GL_GREATER, etc), we get the exact same
                result. Similarly, if we reverse the glDepthRange so that 1 is the depth zNear and 0
                is the depth zFar, we get the same result if we use GL_GREATER. So it's really just
                a convention.</p><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Z-Flip: Never Do This</b></p><p>In the elder days of graphics cards, calling <code class="function">glClear</code> was
                    a slow operation. And this makes sense; clearing images means having to go
                    through every pixel of image data and writing a value to it. Even with hardware
                    optimized routines, if you can avoid doing it, you save some performance.</p><p>Therefore, game developers found clever ways to avoid clearing anything. They
                    avoided clearing the image buffer by ensuring that they would draw to every
                    pixel on the screen every frame. Avoiding clearing the depth buffer was rather
                    more difficult. But depth range and the depth test gave them a way to do
                    it.</p><p>The technique is quite simple. They would need to clear the buffers exactly
                    once, at the beginning of the program. From then on, they would do the
                    following.</p><p>They would render the first frame with a <code class="literal">GL_LESS</code> depth
                    test. However, the depth range would be [0, 0.5]; this would only draw to half
                    of the depth buffer. Since the depth test is less, it does not matter what
                    values just so happened to be between 0.5 and 1.0 in the depth buffer
                    beforehand. And since every pixel was being rendered to as above, the depth
                    buffer is guaranteed to be filled with values that are less than 0.5.</p><p>On the next frame, they would render with a <code class="literal">GL_GREATER</code>
                    depth test. Only this time, the depth range would be [1, 0.5]. Because the last
                    frame filled the depth buffer with values less than 0.5, all of those depth
                    values are automatically <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">behind</span>&#8221;</span> everything rendered now. This
                    fills the depth buffer with values greater than 0.5.</p><p>Rinse and repeat. This ultimately sacrifices one bit of depth precision, since
                    each rendering only uses half of the depth buffer. But it results in never
                    needing to clear the depth or color buffers.</p><p>Oh, and <span class="emphasis"><em>you should never do this.</em></span></p><p>See, hardware developers got really smart. They realized that a clear did not
                    really have to go to each pixel and write a value to it. Instead, they could
                    simply pretend that they had. They built special logic into the memory
                    architecture, such that attempting to read from locations that have been
                        <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">cleared</span>&#8221;</span> results in getting the clear color or depth
                    value.</p><p>Because of that, this z-flip technique is useless. But it's rather worse than
                    that; on most hardware made in the last 7 years, it actually slows down
                    rendering. After all, getting a cleared value doesn't require actually reading
                    memory; the very first value you get from the depth buffer is free. There are
                    other, hardware-specific, optimizations that make z-flip actively damaging to
                    performance.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e5415"></a>Rendering with Depth</h3></div></div></div><p>The <span class="propername">Depth Buffering</span> project shows off how to
                turn on and use the depth buffer. It is based on the BaseVertex rendering of the
                objects.</p><p>The initialization routine has all of the basic depth testing code in it:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e5425"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;5.10.&nbsp;Depth Buffer Setup</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);

glDepthFunc(GL_LEQUAL);
glDepthRange(<span class="code-number">0.0f</span>, <span class="code-number">1.0f</span>);</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>These are the most common depth testing parameters. It turns on depth testing,
                sets the test function to less than or equal to, and sets the range mapping to the
                full accepted range.</p><p>It is common to use <code class="literal">GL_LEQUAL</code> instead of
                    <code class="literal">GL_LESS</code>. This allows for the use of multipass algorithms,
                where you render the same geometry with the same vertex shader, but linked with a
                different fragment shader. We'll look at those much, much later.</p><p>The call to <code class="function">glDepthMask</code> causes rendering to write the depth
                value from the fragment to the depth buffer. The activation of depth testing alone
                is not sufficient to actually write depth values. This allows us to have depth
                testing for objects where their <span class="emphasis"><em>own</em></span> depth (the incoming
                fragment's depth) is not written to the depth buffer, even when their color outputs
                are written. We do not use this here, but a special algorithm might need this
                feature.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Due to an odd quirk of OpenGL, writing to the depth buffer is always inactive
                    if <code class="literal">GL_DEPTH_TEST</code> is disabled, regardless of the depth mask.
                    If you just want to write to the depth buffer, without actually doing a test,
                    you must enable <code class="literal">GL_DEPTH_TEST</code> and use the depth function of
                        <code class="literal">GL_ALWAYS.</code></p></div><p>There is one more issue. We know what the depth value is in the depth buffer after
                a fragment is written to it. But what is its value before any rendering is done at
                all? Depth buffers and color buffers are very similar; color buffers get their
                initial colors from calling <code class="function">glClear</code>. So you might imagine a
                similar call for depth buffers.</p><p>As it turns out, they share the same clearing call. If you recall,
                    <code class="function">glClearColor</code> sets the color for clearing color buffers.
                Similarly, <code class="function">glClearDepth</code> sets the depth value that the depth
                buffer will be cleared to.</p><p>In order to clear the depth buffer with <code class="function">glClear</code>, you must use
                the <code class="literal">GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT</code>. So, the drawing function's clearing, at
                the top of the function, happens as follows:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e5480"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;5.11.&nbsp;Depth Buffer Clearing</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">glClearColor(<span class="code-number">0.0f</span>, <span class="code-number">0.0f</span>, <span class="code-number">0.0f</span>, <span class="code-number">0.0f</span>);

                    is concerned. However, in order to use depth buffering, the framebuffer must
                    include a depth buffer in addition to an image buffer. This initialization code
                    is platform-specific, but FreeGLUT takes care of it for us. If you do graduate
                    from FreeGLUT, make sure that you use the appropriate initialization mechanism
