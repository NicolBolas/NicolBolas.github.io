        different locations and orientations in the world. And we will also solve the secret of why
        we overcomplicated everything with those matrices.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e5963"></a>Spaces</h2></div></div></div><p>Throughout this series of tutorials, we have discussed a number of different spaces.
            We have seen OpenGL-defined spaces like normalized device coordinate (NDC) space,
            clip-space, and window space. And we have seen user-defined spaces like camera space.
            But we have yet to formally discuss about what a space actually is.</p><p>A <em class="glossterm">space</em> is a shorthand term for a <em class="glossterm">coordinate
                system.</em> For the purposes of this conversation, a coordinate system or
            space consists of the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The dimensionality of the space. 2D, 3D, 4D, etc.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A series of vectors in those dimensions that define the axes of the space. The
                    directions do not have to be orthogonal (at right-angles) to one another, but
                    there must be one axis per dimension. Each axis vector in the space has a name,
                    like X, Y, Z, etc. These are called the <em class="glossterm">basis vectors</em> of
                    a space.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A location in the space that defines the central <em class="glossterm">origin</em>
                    point. The origin is the point from which all other points in the space are
                    derived.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>An area within this space in which points are valid. Outside of this range,
                    positions are not valid. The range can be infinite depending on the
                    space.</p></li></ul></div><p>A position or vertex in a space is defined as the sum of the basis vectors, where each
            basis vector is multiplied by a scalar value called a coordinate. Geometrically, this
            looks like the following:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e5997"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;6.1.&nbsp;Two 2D Coordinate Systems</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="CoordSys2D.svg" alt="Two 2D Coordinate Systems"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>These are two different coordinate systems. The same coordinate, in this case (2, 2)
            (each basis vector is added twice) can have two very different positions, from the point
            of view of a neutral observer. What is interesting to note is that (2, 2) is the same
            value in their own coordinate system. This means that a coordinate itself is not enough
            information to know what it means; one must also know what coordinate system it is in
            before you can know anything about it.</p><p>The numerical version of the coordinate system equation is as follows:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e6007"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;6.1.&nbsp;Coordinate System</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="FullCoordinateEquation.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>The geometric version is all well and good when dealing with the geometric basis
            vectors and origin point. The origin point is just a position, and the basis vectors are
            simply drawn. But what does it mean to give actual numbers to these concepts in the
            numerical version? A position, like the origin point, is itself a coordinate. Which
            means that it must be defined relative to some coordinate system. The same goes for the
            basis vectors.</p><p>Ultimately, this means that we cannot look numerically at a single coordinate system.
            Since the coordinate values themselves are meaningless without a coordinate system, a
            coordinate system can only be numerically expressed in relation to another coordinate
            system.</p><p>Technically, the geometric version of coordinate systems works the same way. The
            length of the basis vectors in the geometric diagrams are relative to our own
            self-imposed sense of length and space. Essentially, everything is relative to
            something, and we will explore this in the near future.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e6019"></a>Transformation</h3></div></div></div><p>In the more recent tutorials, the ones dealing with perspective projections, we
                have been taking positions in one coordinate system (space) and putting them in
                another coordinate system. Specifically, we had objects in camera space that we
                moved into clip space. The process of taking a coordinate in one space and
                specifying it as a coordinate in another space is called
                    <em class="glossterm">transformation</em>. The coordinate's actual meaning has not
                changed; all that has changed is the coordinate system that this coordinate is
                relative to.</p><p>We have seen a number of coordinate system transformations. OpenGL implements the
                transformation from clip-space to NDC space and the transformation from NDC to
                window space. Our shaders implement the transformation from camera space to
                clip-space, and this was done using a matrix. Perspective projection (and
                orthographic, for that matter) are simply a special kind of transformation.</p><p>This tutorial will cover a large number of different kinds of transform
                operations and how to implement them in OpenGL.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e6031"></a>Model Space</h3></div></div></div><p>Before we begin, we must define a new kind of space: <em class="glossterm">model
                    space.</em> This is a user-defined space, but unlike camera space, model
                space does not have a single definition. It is instead a catch-all term for the
                space that a particular object begins in. Coordinates in buffer objects, passed to
                the vertex shaders as vertex attributes are <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">de facto</em></span>
                in model space.</p><p>There are an infinite variety of model spaces. Each object one intends to render
                can, and often does, have its own model space, even if the difference between these
                spaces is only in the origin point. Model spaces for an object are generally defined
                for the convenience of the modeller or the programmer who intends to use that
                model.</p><p>The transformation operation being discussed in this tutorial is the transform
                from model space to camera space. Our shaders already know how to handle
                camera-space data; all they need is a way to transform from model space to camera
                space.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tut05 Glossary.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Positioning.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut06 Translation.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Glossary&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Translation</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
