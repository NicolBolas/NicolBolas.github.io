            the initial space being different from the orientation of the destination space. The
            basis vectors of the space do not change orientation relative to one another, but
            relative to the destination coordinate system, they are pointed in different directions
            than they were in their own coordinate system.</p><p>A rotation looks like this:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e6309"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;6.6.&nbsp;Coordinate Rotation in 2D</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="RotationTransform.svg" alt="Coordinate Rotation in 2D"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Rotations are usually considered the most complex of the basic transformations,
            primarily because of the math involved in computing the transformation matrix.
            Generally, rotations are looked at as an operation, such as rotating around a particular
            basis vector or some such. The prior part of the tutorial laid down some of the
            groundwork that will make this much simpler.</p><p>First, let's look back at our equation for determining what the position of a
            coordinate is relative to certain coordinate space:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="CoordinateEquation.svg"></div></div><p>Does not this look a bit familiar? No? Maybe this look at vector-matrix multiplication
            will jog your memory:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="VectorMatrixMultiplication.svg"></div></div><p>Still nothing? Perhaps an alternate look would help:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e6331"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;6.5.&nbsp;Vectorized Matrix Multiplication</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="CoordSysMatrixMultiply.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>Does it look familiar <span class="emphasis"><em>now</em></span>?</p><p>What this tells us is that the columns of our transformation matrices are, and have
                <span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> been, nothing more than the axes of a coordinate system.
            Except for the fourth column; because the input position has a 1 in the W, it acts as an
            offset.</p><p>Transformation from one space to another ultimately means this: taking the basis
            vectors and origin point from the original coordinate system and re-expressing them
            relative to the destination coordinate system. The transformation matrix from one space
            to another contains the basis vectors and origin of the original coordinate system, but
            the <span class="emphasis"><em>values</em></span> of those basis vectors and origin are relative to the
            destination coordinate system.</p><p>Earlier, we said that numerical coordinates of a space must be expressed relative to
            another space. A matrix is a numerical representation of a coordinate system, and its
            values are expressed in the destination coordinate system. Therefore, a transformation
            matrix takes values in one coordinate system and transforms them into another. It does
            this by taking the basis vectors and origin of the input coordinate system and
            represents them relative to the output space. To put it another way, the transformation
            from space A to space B is what space A looks like from an observer in space B.</p><p>A rotation matrix is just a transform that expresses the basis vectors of the input
            space in a different orientation. The length of the basis vectors will be the same, and
            the origin will not change. Also, the angle between the basis vectors will not change.
            All that changes is the relative direction of all of the basis vectors.</p><p>Therefore, a rotation matrix is not really a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">rotation</span>&#8221;</span> matrix; it is an
                <span class="emphasis"><em>orientation</em></span> matrix. It defines the orientation of one space
            relative to another space. Remember this, and you will avoid many pitfalls when you
            start dealing with more complex transformations.</p><p>For any two spaces, the orientation transformation between then can be expressed as
            rotating the source space by some angle around a particular axis (specified in the
            initial space). This is true for any change of orientation.</p><p>A common rotation question is to therefore compute a rotation around an arbitrary
            axis. Or to put it more correctly, to determine the orientation of a space if it is
            rotated around an arbitrary axis. The axis of rotation is expressed in terms of the
            initial space. In 2D, there is only one axis that can be rotated around and still remain
            within that 2D plane: the Z-axis.</p><p>In 3D, there are many possible axes of rotation. It does not have to be one of the
            initial space's basis axes; it can be any arbitrary direction. Of course, the problem is
            made much simpler if one rotates only around the primary axes.</p><p>Deriving these matrix equations is beyond the scope of this tutorial; so instead, we
            will simply provide them. To perform rotations along the primary axes, use the following
            matrices:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e6372"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;6.6.&nbsp;Axial Rotation Matrices</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="AxialRotationMatrices.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>When using the standard C/C++ library <code class="function">sin</code> and
                <code class="function">cos</code> functions, the angles must be in radians.</p><p>As useful as these are, the more generic equation for rotation by an angle about an
            arbitrary axis is as follows.</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e6388"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;6.7.&nbsp;Angle/Axis Rotation Matrix</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="AngleAxisRotationMatrix.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>All of these matrices are such that, from the point of view of an observer looking
            down the axis of rotation (the positive direction of the axis is pointed into the eye of
            the observer), the object rotates counter-clockwise with positive angles.</p><p>The <span class="propername">Rotations</span> tutorial shows off each of these
            rotation matrix functions. Similar to how the others work, there are multiple instances
            rendered based on functions.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e6401"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;6.7.&nbsp;Rotation Project</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Rotations.png" alt="Rotation Project"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The function that builds the transformation matrix looks like this:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e6409"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;6.4.&nbsp;Rotation Transformation Building</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">glm::mat4 ConstructMatrix(<span class="code-keyword">float</span> fElapsedTime)
