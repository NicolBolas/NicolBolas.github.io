            an object. Gimbals can be locked, and it is very unintuitive to control them. How do we
            fix these problems?</p><p>Part of the problem is that we are trying to store an orientation as a series of 3
            accumulated axial rotations. Orientations are <span class="emphasis"><em>orientations,</em></span> not
            rotations. And orientations are certainly not a series of rotations. So we need to treat
            the orientation of the ship as an orientation, as a specific quantity.</p><p>The first thought towards this end would be to keep the orientation as a matrix. When
            the time comes to modify the orientation, we simply apply a transformation to this
            matrix, storing the result as the new current orientation.</p><p>This means that every yaw, pitch, and roll applied to the current orientation will be
            relative to that current orientation. Which is precisely what we need. If the user
            applies a positive yaw, you want that yaw to rotate them relative to where they are
            current pointing, not relative to some fixed coordinate system.</p><p>There are a few downsides to this approach. First, a 4x4 matrix is rather larger than
            3 floating-point angles. But a much more difficult issue is that successive
            floating-point math can lead to errors. If you keep accumulating successive
            transformations of an object, once every 1/30th of a second for a period of several
            minutes or hours, these floating-point errors start accumulating. Eventually, the
            orientation stops being a pure rotation and starts incorporating scale and skewing
            characteristics.</p><p>The solution here is to re-orthonormalize the matrix after applying each transform. A
            coordinate system (which a matrix defines) is said to be
                <em class="glossterm">orthonormal</em> if the basis vectors are of unit length (no
            scale) and each axis is perpendicular to all of the others.</p><p>Unfortunately, re-orthonormalizing a matrix is not a simple operation. You could try
            to normalize each of the axis vectors with typical vector normalization, but that
            would not ensure that the matrix was orthonormal. It would remove scaling, but the axes
            would not be guaranteed to be perpendicular.</p><p>Orthonormalization is certainly possible. But there are better solutions. Such as using
            something called a <em class="glossterm">quaternion.</em></p><p>A quaternion is (for the purposes of this conversation) a 4-dimensional vector that is
            treated in a special way. Any pure orientation change from one coordinate system to
            another can be represented by a rotation about some axis by some angle. A quaternion is
            a way of encoding this angle/axis rotation:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e8163"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;8.1.&nbsp;Angle/Axis to Quaternion</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="AngleAxisToQuaternion.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>Assuming the axis itself is a unit vector, this will produce a <em class="glossterm">unit
                quaternion.</em> That is, a quaternion with a length of 1.</p><p>Quaternions can be considered to be two parts: a vector part and a scalar part. The
            vector part are the first three components, when displayed in the order above. The
            scalar part is the last part.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8176"></a>Quaternion Math</h3></div></div></div><p>Quaternions are equivalent to orientation matrices. You can compose two
                orientation quaternions using a special operation called <em class="glossterm">quaternion
                    multiplication</em>. Given the quaternions <code class="literal">a</code> and
                    <code class="literal">b</code>, the product of them is:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e8190"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;8.2.&nbsp;Quaternion Multiplication</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="QuaternionMultiplication.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>If the two quaternions being multiplied represent orientations, then the product
                of them is a composite orientation. This works like matrix multiplication, except
                only for orientations. Like matrix multiplication, quaternion multiplication is
                associative (<span class="mathphrase">(a*b) * c = a * (b*c)</span>), but not commutative (<span class="mathphrase">a*b != b*a</span>).</p><p>The main difference between matrices and quaternions that matters for our needs is
                that it is easy to keep a quaternion normalized. Simply perform a vector
                normalization on it after every few multiplications. This enables us to add numerous
                small rotations together without numerical precision problems showing up.</p><p>There is one more thing we need to be able to do: convert a quaternion into a
                rotation matrix. While we could convert a unit quaternion back into angle/axis
                rotations, it's much preferable to do it directly:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e8210"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;8.3.&nbsp;Quaternion to Matrix</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="QuaternionToMatrix.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>This does look suspiciously similar to the formula for generating a matrix from an
                angle/axis rotation.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8218"></a>Composition Type</h3></div></div></div><p>So our goal is to compose successive rotations into a final orientation. When we
                want to increase the pitch, for example, we will take the current orientation and
                multiply into it a quaternion that represents a pitch rotation of a few degrees. The
                result becomes the new orientation.</p><p>But which side do we do the multiplication on? Quaternion multiplication is not
                commutative, so this will have an affect on the output. Well, it works exactly like
                matrix math.</p><p>Our positions (p) are in model space. We are transforming them into world space.
                The current transformation matrix is represented by the orientation O. Thus, to
                transform points, we use <span class="mathphrase">O*p</span></p><p>Now, we want to adjust the orientation O by applying some small pitch change.
                Well, the pitch of the model is defined by model space. Therefore, the pitch change
                (R) is a transformation that takes coordinates in model space and transforms them to
                the pitch space. So our total transformation is <span class="mathphrase">O*R*p</span>; the new orientation is <span class="mathphrase">O*R</span>.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8240"></a>Yaw Pitch Roll</h3></div></div></div><p>We implement this in the <span class="propername">Quaternion YPR</span>
