            another. If we have two orientations, we can consider the orientation of the same object
            represented in both coordinate systems.</p><p>What if we want to generate an orientation that is halfway between them, for some
            definition of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">halfway</span>&#8221;</span>? Or even better, consider an arbitrary
            interpolation between two orientations, so that we can watch an object move from one
            orientation to another. This would allow us to see an object smoothly moving from one
            orientation to another.</p><p>This is one more trick we can play with quaternions that we cannot with matrices.
            Linearly-interpolating the components of matrices does not create anything that
            resembles an inbetween transformation. However, linearly interpolating a pair of
            quaternions does. As long as you normalize the results.</p><p>The <span class="propername">Interpolation</span> tutorial demonstrates this. The
                <span class="keycap"><strong>Q</strong></span>, <span class="keycap"><strong>W</strong></span>, <span class="keycap"><strong>E</strong></span>, <span class="keycap"><strong>R</strong></span>,
                <span class="keycap"><strong>T</strong></span>, <span class="keycap"><strong>Y</strong></span>, and <span class="keycap"><strong>U</strong></span> keys cause the ship
            to interpolate to a new orientation. Each key corresponds to a particular orientation,
            and the <span class="keycap"><strong>Q</strong></span> key is the initial orientation.</p><p>We can see that there are some pretty reasonable looking transitions. The transition
            from <span class="keycap"><strong>Q</strong></span> to <span class="keycap"><strong>W</strong></span>, for example. However, there are some
            other transitions that do not look so good; the <span class="keycap"><strong>Q</strong></span> to <span class="keycap"><strong>E</strong></span>
            transition. What exactly is going on?</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8596"></a>The Long Path</h3></div></div></div><p>Unit quaternions represent orientations, but they are also vector directions.
                Specifically, directions in a four-dimensional space. Being unit vectors, they
                represent points on a 4D sphere of radius one. Therefore, the path between two
                orientations can be considered to be simply moving from one direction to another on
                the surface of the 4D sphere.</p><p>While unit quaternions do represent orientations, a quaternion is not a
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>unique</em></span> representation of an orientation. That is, there are
                multiple quaternions that represent the same orientation. Well, there are
                two.</p><p>The conjugate of a quaternion, its inverse orientation, is the negation of the
                vector part of the quaternion. If you negate all four components however, you get
                something quite different: the same orientation as before. Negating a quaternion
                does not affect its orientation.</p><p>While the two quaternions represent the same orientation, they are not the same as
                far as interpolation is concerned. Consider a two-dimensional case:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e8610"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;8.5.&nbsp;Interpolation Directions</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="InterpolateDirection.svg" alt="Interpolation Directions"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>If the angle between the two quaternions is greater than 90&deg;, then the
                interpolation between them will take the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">long path</span>&#8221;</span> between the two
                orientations. Which is what we see in the <span class="keycap"><strong>Q</strong></span> to <span class="keycap"><strong>E</strong></span>
                transition. The orientation <span class="keycap"><strong>R</strong></span> is the negation of
                <span class="keycap"><strong>E</strong></span>; if you try to interpolate between them, nothing changes. The
                    <span class="keycap"><strong>Q</strong></span> to <span class="keycap"><strong>R</strong></span> transition looks much better
                behaved.</p><p>This can be detected easily enough. If the 4-vector dot product between the two
                quaternions is less than zero, then the long path will be taken. If you want to
                prevent the long path from being used, simply negate one of the quaternions before
                interpolating if you detect this. Similarly, if you want to force the long path,
                then ensure that the angle is greater than 90&deg; by negating a quaternion if the dot
                product is greater than zero.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8641"></a>Interpolation Speed</h3></div></div></div><p>There is another problem. Notice how fast the <span class="keycap"><strong>Q</strong></span> to
                    <span class="keycap"><strong>E</strong></span> interpolation is. It starts off slow, then rapidly spins
                around, then slows down towards the end. Why does this happen?</p><p>The linear interpolation code looks like this:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e8654"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;8.5.&nbsp;Quaternion Linear Interpolation</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">glm::fquat Lerp(<span class="code-keyword">const</span> glm::fquat &amp;v0, <span class="code-keyword">const</span> glm::fquat &amp;v1, <span class="code-keyword">float</span> alpha)
{
    glm::vec4 start = Vectorize(v0);
    glm::vec4 end = Vectorize(v1);
    glm::vec4 interp = glm::mix(start, end, alpha);
    interp = glm::normalize(interp);
    <span class="code-keyword">return</span> glm::fquat(interp.w, interp.x, interp.y, interp.z);
}</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>GLM's quaternion support does something unusual. The W component is given
                    first to the <span class="type">fquat</span> constructor. Be aware of that when looking
                    through the code.</p></div><p>The <code class="function">Vectorize</code> function simply takes a quaternion and returns
                a <span class="type">vec4</span>; this is necessary because GLM <span class="type">fquat</span> do not support
                many of the operations that GLM <span class="type">vec4</span>'s do. In this case, the
                    <span class="type">glm::mix</span> function, which performs component-wise linear
                interpolation.</p><p>Each component of the vector is interpolated separately from the rest. The
                quaternion for <span class="keycap"><strong>Q</strong></span> is (0.7071f, 0.7071f, 0.0f, 0.0f), while the
                quaternion for <span class="keycap"><strong>E</strong></span> is (-0.4895f, -0.7892f, -0.3700f, -0.02514f). In
                order for the first componet of Q to get to E's first component, it will have to go
                through zero.</p><p>When the alpha is around 0.5, half-way through the movement, the resultant vector
                before normalization is very small. But the vector itself is not what provides the
                orientation; the <span class="emphasis"><em>direction</em></span> of the 4D vector is. Which is why it
                moves very fast in the middle: the direction is changing rapidly.</p><p>In order to get smooth interpolation, we need to interpolate based on the
                direction of the vectors. That is, we interpolate along the angle between the two
                vectors. This kind of interpolation is called <em class="glossterm">spherical linear
                    interpolation</em> or <em class="glossterm">slerp</em>.</p><p>To see the difference this makes, press the <span class="keycap"><strong>SpaceBar</strong></span>; this
                toggles between regular linear interpolation and slerp. The slerp version is much
                smoother.</p><p>The code for slerp is rather complex:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e8710"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;8.6.&nbsp;Spherical Linear Interpolation</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">glm::fquat Slerp(<span class="code-keyword">const</span> glm::fquat &amp;v0, <span class="code-keyword">const</span> glm::fquat &amp;v1, <span class="code-keyword">float</span> alpha)

}</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Slerp and Performance</b></p><p>It's important to know what kind of problems slerp is intended to solve and
                    what kind it is not. Slerp becomes increasingly more important the more
                    disparate the two quaternions being interpolated are. If you know that two
                    quaternions are always quite close to one another, then slerp is not worth the
                    expense.</p><p>The <code class="function">acos</code> call in the slerp code alone is pretty
                    substantial in terms of performance. Whereas lerp is typically just a
                    vector/scalar multiply followed by a vector/vector addition. Even on the CPU,
                    the performance difference is important, particularly if you're doing thousands
                    of these per frame.
