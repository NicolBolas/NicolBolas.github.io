Namely, a single triangle. Maybe the triangle
        moved around or had some colors.</p><p>This tutorial is all about how to create a realistic world of objects.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e3718"></a>The Unreal World</h2></div></div></div><p>The <span class="propername">Orthographic Cube</span> tutorial renders a
            rectangular prism (a 3D rectangle). The dimensions of the prism are 0.5x0.5x1.5, so it
            is longer in the Z axis by 3x the X and Y.</p><p>The code in this tutorial should be familiar, for the most part. We simply draw 12
            triangles rather than one. The rectangular faces of the prism are made of 2 triangles,
            splitting the face along one of the diagonals.</p><p>The vertices also have a color. However, the color for the 6 vertices that make up a
            face is always the same; this gives each face a single, uniform color.</p><p>The vertex shader is a combination of things we know. It passes a color through to the
            fragment stage, but it also takes a <span class="type">vec2</span> offset uniform that it adds an
            offset to the X and Y components of the position. The fragment shader simply takes the
            interpolated color and uses it as the output color.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tut04_face_culling"></a>Face Culling</h3></div></div></div><p>There is one very noteworthy code change, however: the initialization routine. It

                lot of binary on/off flags that are part of OpenGL's state.
                    <code class="function">glEnable</code> is used to set these flags to the
                    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">on</span>&#8221;</span> position. Similarly, there is a <code class="function">glDisable</code>
                function that sets the flag to <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">off.</span>&#8221;</span></p><p>The <code class="literal">GL_CULL_FACE</code> flag, when enabled, tells OpenGL to activate
                    <em class="glossterm">face culling</em>. Up until now, we have been rendering with
                face culling off.</p><p>Face culling is a useful feature for saving performance. Take our rectangular
                prism, for example. Pick up a remote control; their general shape is that of a
                rectangular prism. No matter how you look at it or orient it, you can never see more
                than 3 sides of it at once. So why bother spending all that fragment processing time
                drawing the other three sides?</p><p>Face culling is a way of telling OpenGL not to draw the sides of an object that
                you cannot see. It is quite simple, really.</p><p>In window space, after the transform from normalized device coordinates, you have
                a triangle. Each vertex of that triangle was presented to OpenGL in a specific
                order. This gives you a way of numbering the vertices of the triangle.</p><p>No matter what size or shape the triangle is, you can classify the ordering of a
                triangle in two ways: clockwise or counter-clockwise. That is, if the order of the
                vertices from 1 to 2 to 3 moves clockwise in a circle, relative to the triangle's
                center, then the triangle is facing clockwise relative to the viewer. Otherwise, the
                triangle is counter-clockwise relative to the viewer. This ordering is called the
                    <em class="glossterm">winding order.</em></p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e3781"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;4.1.&nbsp;Triangle Winding Order</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="WindingOrder.svg" alt="Triangle Winding Order"></div><div class="caption"><p>The left triangle has a clockwise winding order; the triangle on the right
                        has a counter-clockwise winding order.</p></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Face culling in OpenGL works based on this ordering. Setting this is a two-step
                process, and is accomplished by the last two statements of the initialization
                function.</p><p>The <code class="function">glFrontFace</code> defines which winding order, clockwise or
                counter-clockwise, is considered to be the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">front</span>&#8221;</span> side of the
                triangle. This function can be given either <code class="literal">GL_CW</code> or
                    <code class="literal">GL_CCW</code>, for clockwise and counter-clockwise
                respectively.</p><p>The <code class="function">glCullFace</code> function defines which side, front or back,
                gets culled. This can be given <code class="literal">GL_BACK</code>,
                    <code class="literal">GL_FRONT</code>, or <code class="literal">GL_FRONT_AND_BACK</code>. The latter
                culls <span class="emphasis"><em>everything,</em></span> so no triangles are rendered. This can be
                useful for measuring vertex shader performance but is less useful for actually
                drawing anything.</p><p>The triangle data in the tutorial is specifically ordered so that the clockwise
                facing of the triangles face out. This prevents the drawing of the rear-facing
                faces.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e3825"></a>Lack of Perspective</h3></div></div></div><p>So, the image looks like this:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e3830"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;4.2.&nbsp;Orthographic Prism</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="OrthoPrism.png" alt="Orthographic Prism"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>There's something wrong with this. Namely, that it looks like a square.</p><p>Pick up a remote control again. Point it directly at your eye and position it so
                that it is in the center of your vision. You should only be able to see the front
                panel of the remote.</p><p>Now, move it to the right and up, similar to where the square is. You should be
                able to see the bottom and left side of the remote.</p><p>So we should be able to see the bottom and left side of our rectangular prism. But
                we cannot. Why not?</p><p>Think back to how rendering happens. In clip-space, the vertices of the back end
                of the rectangular prism are directly behind the front end. And when we transform
                these into window coordinates, the back vertices are still directly behind the front
                vertices. This is what the rasterizer sees, so this is what the rasterizer
                renders.</p><p>There has to be something that reality is doing that we are not. That something is
