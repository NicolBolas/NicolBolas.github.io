The
                <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">needlessly overcomplicated for the time being but will make sense in a few
                tutorials</span>&#8221;</span> way.</p><p>First, let us look at the system of equations used to compute clip coordinates from
            camera space. Given that <code class="literal">S</code> is the frustum scale factor,
                <code class="literal">N</code> is the zNear and <code class="literal">F</code> is the zFar, we get the
            following four equations.</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e4251"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;4.3.&nbsp;Camera to Clip Equations</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="CameraToClipPartial.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>The odd spacing is intentional. For laughs, let's add a bunch of meaningless terms
            that do not change the equation, but starts to develop an interesting pattern:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e4259"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;4.4.&nbsp;Camera to Clip Expanded Equations</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="CameraToClipNearMatrix.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>What we have here is what is known as a linear system of equations. The equations can
            be specified as a series of coefficients (the numbers being multiplied by the XYZW
            values) which are multiplied by the input values (XYZW) to produce the single output.
            Each individual output value is a linear combination of all of the input values. In our
            case, there just happen to be a lot of zero coefficients, so the output values in this
            particular case only depend on a few input values.</p><p>You may be wondering at the multiplication of the additive term of
                Z<sub>clip</sub>'s value by the camera space W. Well, our input camera
            space position's W coordinate is always 1. So performing the multiplication is valid, so
            long as this continues to be the case. Being able to do what we are about to do is part
            of the reason why the W coordinate exists in our camera-space position values (the perspective divide is the other).</p><p>We can re-express any linear system of equations using a special kind of formulation.
            You may recognize this reformulation, depending on your knowledge of linear
            algebra:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e4274"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;4.5.&nbsp;Camera to Clip Matrix Transformation</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="CameraToClipMatrix.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>The two long vertical columns of XYZW labeled <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">clip</span>&#8221;</span> and
                <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">camera</span>&#8221;</span> are 4-dimensional vectors; namely the clip and camera space
            position vectors. The larger block of numbers is a matrix. You probably are not familiar
            with matrix math. If not, it will be explained presently.</p><p>Generically speaking, a <em class="glossterm">matrix</em> is a two dimensional block of
            numbers (matrices with more than 2 dimensions are called <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">tensors</span>&#8221;</span>).
            Matrices are very common in computer graphics. Thus far, we have been able to get along
            without them. As we get into more detailed object transformations however, we will rely
            more and more on matrices to simplify matters.</p><p>In graphics work, we typically use 4x4 matrices; that is, matrices with 4 columns and
            4 rows respectively. This is due to the nature of graphics work: most of the things that
            we want to use matrices for are either 3 dimensional or 3 dimensional with an extra
            coordinate of data. Our 4D positions are just 3D positions with a 1 added to the
            end.</p><p>The operation depicted above is a vector-matrix multiplication. A matrix of dimension
                <code class="literal">n</code>x<code class="literal">m</code> can only be multiplied by a vector of
            dimension <code class="literal">n</code>. The result of such a multiplication is a vector of
            dimension <code class="literal">m</code>. Since our matrix in this case is 4x4, it can only be
            multiplied with a 4D vector and this multiplication will produce a 4D vector.</p><p>Matrix multiplication does what the expanded equation example does. For every row in
            the matrix, the values of each component of the column are multiplied by the
            corresponding values in the rows of the vector. These values are then added together;
            that becomes the single value for the row of the output vector.</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e4314"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;4.6.&nbsp;Vector Matrix Multiplication</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="VectorMatrixMultiplication.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>This results ultimately in performing 16 floating-point multiplications and 12
            floating-point additions. That's quite a lot, particularly compared with our current
            version. Fortunately, graphics hardware is designed to make these operations very fast.
            Because each of the multiplications are independent of each other, they could all be
            done simultaneously, which is exactly the kind of thing graphics hardware does fast.
            Similarly, the addition operations are partially independent; each row's summation
            does not depend on the values from any other row. Ultimately, vector-matrix
            multiplication usually generates only 4 instructions in the GPU's machine
            language.</p><p>We can re-implement the above perspective projection using matrix math rather than
            explicit math. The <span class="propername">MatrixPerspective</span> tutorial does
            this.</p><p>The vertex shader is much simpler in this case:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e4329"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;4.4.&nbsp;MatrixPerspective Vertex Shader</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">#version <span class="code-number">330</span>

}</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>The OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL), being designed for graphics operations, naturally
            has matrices as basic types. The <span class="type">mat4</span> is a 4x4 matrix (columns x rows).
            GLSL has types for all combinations of columns and rows between 2 and 4. Square matrices
            (matrices where the number of columns and rows are equal) only use one number, as in
                <span class="type">mat4</span> above. So <span class="type">mat3</span> is a 3x3 matrix. If the matrix is not
            square, GLSL uses notation like <span class="type">mat2x4</span>: a matrix with 2 columns and 4
            rows.</p><p>Note that the shader no longer computes the values on its own; it is
                <span class="emphasis"><em>given</em></span> a matrix with all of the stored values as a uniform. This
            is simply because there is no need for it. All of the objects in a particular scene will
            be rendered with the same perspective matrix, so there is no need to waste potentially
            precious vertex shader time doing redundant computations.</p><p>Vector-matrix multiplication is such a common operation in graphics that operator * is
            used to perform it. So the second line of <code class="function">main</code> multiplies the
            perspective matrix by the camera position.</p><p>Please note the <span class="emphasis"><em>order</em></span> of this operation. The matrix is on the
            left and the vector is on the right. Matrix multiplication is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
            commutative, so M*v is not the same thing as v*M. Normally vectors are considered 1xN
            matrices (where N is the size of the vector). When you multiply vectors on the left of
            the matrix, GLSL considers it an Nx1 matrix; this is the only way to make the
            multiplication make sense. This will multiply the single row of the vector with each
            column, summing the results, creating a new vector. This is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
            what we want to do. We want to multiply rows of the matrix by the vector, not columns of
            the matrix. Put the vector on the right, not the left.</p><p>The program initialization routine has a few changes:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e4371"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;4.5.&nbsp;Program Initialization of Perspective Matrix</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">offsetUniform = glGetUniformLocation(theProgram, <span class="code-string">"offset"</span>);

            numbers called <code class="varname">theMatrix</code>. Since most of the values are zero, we can
            just set the whole thing to zero. This works because IEEE 32-bit floating-point numbers
            represent a zero as 4 bytes that all contain zero.</p><p>The next few functions set the particular values of interest into the matrix. Before
            we can understand what's going on here, we need to talk a bit about ordering.</p><p>A 4x4 matrix is technically 16 values, so a 16-entry array can store a matrix. But
            there are two ways to store a matrix as an array. One way is called
                <em class="glossterm">column-major</em> order, the other naturally is
                <em class="glossterm">row-major</em> order. Column-major order means that, for an NxM
            matrix (columns x rows), the first N values in the array are the first column
            (top-to-bottom), the next N values are the second column, and so forth. In row-major
            order, the first M values in the array are the first row (left-to-right), followed by
            another M values for the second row, and so forth.</p><p>In this example, the matrix is stored in column-major order. So array index 14 is in
            the third row of the fourth column.</p><p>The entire matrix is a single uniform. To transfer the matrix to OpenGL, we use the
                <code class="function">glUniformMatrix4fv</code> function. The first parameter is the uniform
            location that we are uploading to. This function can be used to transfer an entire array
            of matrices (yes, uniform arrays of any type are possible), so the second parameter is
            the number of array entries. Since we're only providing one matrix, this value is
            1.</p><p>The third parameter tells OpenGL what the ordering of the matrix data is. If it is
                <code class="literal">GL_TRUE</code>, then the matrix data is in row-major order. Since our
            data is column-major, we set it to <code class="literal">GL_FALSE</code>. The last parameter is
            the matrix data itself.</p><p>Running this program will give us:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e4408"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;4.9.&nbsp;Perspective Matrix</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="MatrixPerspective.png" alt="Perspective Matrix"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The same thing we had before.
