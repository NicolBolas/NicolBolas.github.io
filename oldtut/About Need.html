            those familiar with fixed functionality who want to understand programmable rendering
            better. But this is not a book for beginning programmers.</p><p>You are expected to be able to read C and reasonable C++ code. If <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Hello,
                world!</span>&#8221;</span> is the extent of your C/C++ knowledge, then perhaps you should write
            some more substantial code before proceeding with trying to render images. 3D graphics
            rendering is simply not a beginner programming task; this is just as true for
            traditional graphics learning as for modern graphics learning.</p><p>These tutorials should be transferable to other languages as well. If you can read
            C/C++, that is enough to understand what the code is doing. The text descriptions that
            explain what the code does are also sufficient to get information out of these
            tutorials.</p><p>Any substantial discussion of 3D rendering requires a discussion of mathematics, which
            are at the foundation of all 3D graphics. This book expects you to know basic geometry
            and algebra.</p><p>The tutorials will present the more advanced math needed for graphics as it becomes
            necessary, but you should have at least a working knowledge of geometry and algebra.
            Linear algebra is not required, though it would be helpful.</p><p>The code tutorials in this book use OpenGL as their rendering API. You do not need to
            know OpenGL, but to execute the code, you must have a programming environment that
            allows OpenGL. Specifically, you will need hardware capable of running OpenGL version
            3.3. This means any GeForce 8xxx or better, or any Radeon HD-class card. These are also
            called <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Direct3D 10</span>&#8221;</span> cards, but you do not need Windows Vista or 7 to use
            their advanced features through OpenGL.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="About this Book.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="About this Book.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="About Organization.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">About this Book&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Organization of This Book</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
