Each subject contains
            several numbered chapters called tutorials. Each tutorial describes several related
            concepts. In virtually every case, each concept is demonstrated by a companion set of
            code.</p><p>Each tutorial begins with an overview of the concepts that will be discussed and
            demonstrated. At the end of each tutorial is a review section and a glossary of all
            terms introduced in that tutorial. The review section will explain the concepts
            presented in the tutorial. It will also contain suggestions for playing with the source
            code itself; these are intended to further your understanding of these concepts. If the
            tutorial introduced new OpenGL functions or functions for the OpenGL shading language,
            they will be reviewed here as well.</p><p>This is a book for beginning graphics programmers. Graphics is a huge topic, and this
            book will not cover every possible effect, feature, or technique. This book will also
            not cover every technique in full detail. Sometimes techniques will be revisited in
            later materials, but there simply isn't enough space to say everything about everything.
            Therefore, when certain techniques are introduced, there will be a section at the end
            providing some cursory examination of more advanced techniques. This will help you
            further your own research into graphics programming, as you will know what to search for
            online or in other books.</p><p>Each tutorial ends with a glossary of all of the terms defined in that
            tutorial.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Browser Note</h3><p>This website and these tutorials make extensive use of SVG images. Basic SVG
                support is in all major browsers except all Internet Explorer versions before
                version 9. If you are content with these versions of Internet Explorer (or unable to
                upgrade), consider installing the Google Chrome Frame add-on for IE8. This will
                allow you to see the images correctly.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="About Need.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="About this Book.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="About Conventions.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">What You Need&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Conventions used in This Book</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
