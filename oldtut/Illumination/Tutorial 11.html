Few objects
        in reality conform to this archetype. Therefore, in order to more accurately model real
        objects, we need to improve upon this. Let us focus on making objects appear shiny.</p><p>Shiny materials tend to reflect light more strongly in the opposite direction from the
        angle of incidence (the angle between the surface normal and the incoming light direction).
        This kind of reflection is called a <em class="glossterm">specular reflection.</em> A perfect
        specular reflector would be a mirror.</p><p>One way to show that an object is shiny is to model <em class="glossterm">specular
            highlights.</em> A specular highlight is a bright highlight on an object caused
        by direct illumination from a light source. The position of the highlight changes with the
        view direction as well as the light direction.</p><p>Modelling true specular reflection would require reflecting all light from objects in the
        scene, whether direct or indirect. However for many objects, like shiny plastics and the
        like, indirect specular reflections are very weak. Thus, by modeling direct specular
        reflections, we can make an object appear shiny without having to do too much work.</p><p>We will look at several models for specular highlights and reflection. The Lambertian
        diffuse reflectance model was reasonably good for modelling diffuse lighting, but there are
        several models for specular reflection that should be considered. They vary in quality and
        performance.</p><p>Note that these models do not throw away diffuse lighting. They all act as supplements,
        adding their contribution into the overall result for the lighting equation.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e10806"></a>Microfacets</h2></div></div></div><p>All of these specular reflection models work based on an assumption about the
            characteristics of the surface. If a surface was perfectly smooth, then the specular
            highlight from a point light would be infinitely small (since point lights themselves
            are infinitely small).</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e10812"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;11.1.&nbsp;Perfect Specular Reflection</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="SpecularReflection.svg" alt="Perfect Specular Reflection"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Notice that the intensity of the reflected light depends not only on the angle of
            incidence but also on the direction to the viewer. This is called the <em class="glossterm">angle
                of view</em> or <em class="glossterm">viewing angle</em>. Viewing position A
            detects the light specularly reflected from the surface at the point P, but the viewing
            position B does not.</p><p>Surfaces however are rarely perfect specular reflectors (mirrors are the most common
            perfect reflectors). Surfaces that seem smooth from far away can be rough on closer
            examination. This is true at the microscopic level as well, even for surfaces that
            appear quite smooth. This roughness can be modelled by assuming that a surface is
            composed of a number of <em class="glossterm">microfacets.</em></p><p>A microfacet is a flat plane that is oriented in a single direction. Each microfacet
            reflects light perfectly in that direction. Surfaces with microfacets would look like
            this:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e10832"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;11.2.&nbsp;Smooth and Rough Microfacets</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="MicrofacetRoughSmooth.svg" alt="Smooth and Rough Microfacets"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>It is part of the microfacet model's assumption that many microfacets on a surface
            will contribute to the light returned under a single pixel of the final image. So each
            pixel in the rendered image is the result of an aggregate of the microfacets that lie
            under the area of that pixel on the surface.</p><p>The average normal of the microfacets is the surface normal at that point. The
            relative smoothness of a surface can therefore be modeled as a statistical distribution
            of the orientation of microfacets on the surface. A smooth surface has a distribution
            close to the average, while a rough surface has a broader distribution.</p><p>Thus, a model of specular reflections includes a term that defines the overall
            smoothness of the source. This is a surface characteristic, representing the
            distribution of microfacets using whatever statistical distribution the particular
            specular model is using. One of the main differences between specular models is the kind
            of statistical distribution that they use.</p><p>Specular highlights are formed because, even though the surface normal may not be
            oriented to directly reflect light from the light source to the viewer, some microfacets
            may still be oriented to reflect a portion of that light. A microfacet distribution
            model determines the proportion of microfacets that happen to be oriented to reflect
            light towards the viewer.</p><p>Smooth surfaces, those who's microfacets do not deviate much from the surface normal,
            will have a small, bright highlight. Rough surfaces, who's microfacets are oriented in
            wildly divergent directions, will have a much dimmer, but larger specular highlight.
            These highlights will have positions and shapes based on the angle of incidence and the
            angle of view.</p><p>Note that specular reflectance models do not become diffuse reflectance models when
            taken to the extreme case of maximum roughness. Specular reflection represents a
            different mode of light/surface interaction from diffuse reflection.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tut10 Glossary.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Illumination.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut11 Phong Model.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Glossary&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Phong Model</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
