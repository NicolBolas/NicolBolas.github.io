An increasingly
        accurate one, but it is deception all the same. We are not rendering round objects; we
        simply use lighting and interpolation of surface characteristics to make an object appear
        round. Sometimes we have artifacts or optical illusions that show the lie for what it is.
        Even when the lie is near-perfect, the geometry of a model still does not correspond to what
        the lighting makes the geometry appear to be.</p><p>In this tutorial, we will be looking at the ultimate expression of this lie. We will use
        lighting computations to make an object appear to be something entirely different from its
        geometry.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e12541"></a>Simple Sham</h2></div></div></div><p>We want to render a sphere. We could do this as we have done in previous tutorials.
            That is, generate a mesh of a sphere and render it. But this will never be a
            mathematically perfect sphere. It is easy to generate a sphere with an arbitrary number
            of triangles, and thus improve the approximation. But it will always be an
            approximation.</p><p>Spheres are very simple, mathematically speaking. They are simply the set of points in
            a space that are a certain distance from a specific point. This sounds like something we
            might be able to compute in a shader.</p><p>Our first attempt to render a sphere will be quite simple. We will use the vertex
            shader to compute the vertex positions of a <span class="emphasis"><em>square</em></span> in clip-space.
            This square will be in the same position and width/height as the actual circle would be,
            and it will always face the camera. In the fragment shader, we will compute the position
            and normal of each point along the sphere's surface. By doing this, we can map each
            point on the square to a point on the sphere we are trying to render. This square is
            commonly called a <em class="glossterm">flat card</em> or
            <em class="glossterm">billboard</em>.</p><p>For those points on the square that do not map to a sphere point (ie: the corners), we
            have to do something special. Fragment shaders are required to write a value to the
            output image. But they also have the ability to abort processing and write neither color
            information nor depth to the color and depth buffers. We will employ this to draw our
            square-spheres.</p><p>This technique is commonly called <em class="glossterm">impostors.</em> The idea is that
            we're actually drawing a square, but we use the fragment shaders to make it look like
            something else. The geometric shape is just a placeholder, a way to invoke the fragment
            shader over a certain region of the screen. The fragment shader is where the real magic
            happens.</p><p>The tutorial project <span class="propername">Basic Impostor</span> demonstrates
            this technique. It shows a scene with several spheres, a directional light, and a moving
            point light source.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e12572"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;13.1.&nbsp;Basic Impostor</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Basic%20Impostor.png" alt="Basic Impostor"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The camera movement is controlled in the same way as previous tutorials.

            between actual meshes and impostor spheres. Each sphere is independently

                vertex shader.</p><p>It does still use an input variable: <code class="varname">gl_VertexID</code>. This is a
                built-in input variable; it contains the current index of this particular vertex.
                When using array rendering, it's just the count of the vertex we are in. When using
                indexed rendering, it is the index of this vertex.</p><p>When we render this mesh, we render 4 vertices as a
                    <code class="literal">GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP</code>. This is rendered in array rendering mode,
                so the <code class="varname">gl_VertexID</code> will vary from 0 to 3. Our switch/case
                statement determines which vertex we are rendering. Since we're trying to render a
                square with a triangle strip, the order of the vertices needs to be appropriate for
                this.</p><p>After computing which vertex we are trying to render, we use the radius-based
                offset as a bias to the camera-space sphere position. The Z value of the sphere
                position is left alone, since it will always be correct for our square. After that,

                not need to contain anything either. That is, we never call
                    <code class="function">glEnableVertexAttribArray</code> on the VAO. Since no attribute
                arrays are enabled, we also have no need for a buffer object to store vertex array
                data. So we never call <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code>. We simply
                generate an empty VAO with <code class="function">glGenVertexArrays</code> and use it without

                the sphere that corresponds with the point on the square that we are currently on.
                And to do that, we need a way to tell where on the square we are.</p><p>Using <code class="varname">gl_FragCoord</code> will not help, as it is relative to the
                entire screen. We need a value that is relative only to the impostor square. That is
                the purpose of the <code class="varname">mapping</code> variable. When this variable is at (0,
                0), we are in the center of the square, which is the center of the sphere. When it
                is at (-1, -1), we are at the bottom left corner of the square.</p><p>Given this, we can now compute the sphere point directly <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">above</span>&#8221;</span> the
                point on the square, which is the job of the <code class="function">Impostor</code>
                function.</p><p>Before we can compute the sphere point however, we must make sure that we are
                actually on a point that has the sphere above it. This requires only a simple
                distance check. Since the size of the square is equal to the radius of the sphere,
                if the distance of the <code class="varname">mapping</code> variable from its (0, 0) point is
                greater than 1, then we know that this point is off of the sphere.</p><p>Here, we use a clever way of computing the length; we do not. Instead, we compute
                the square of the length. We know that if <span class="mathphrase">X<sup>2</sup> &gt;
                        Y<sup>2</sup></span> is true, then <span class="mathphrase">X &gt; Y</span> must also be true for all positive real numbers X and Y. So we
                just do the comparison as squares, rather than taking a square-root to find the true
                length.</p><p>If the point is not under the sphere, we execute something new:
                    <code class="literal">discard</code>. The <code class="literal">discard</code> keyword is unique to
                fragment shaders. It tells OpenGL that the fragment is invalid and its data should
                not be written to the image or depth buffers. This allows us to carve out a shape in
                our flat square, turning it into a circle.</p><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>A Word on Discard</b></p><p>Using <code class="literal">discard</code> sounds a lot like throwing an exception.
                    Since the fragment's outputs will be ignored and discarded, you might expect
                    that executing this instruction will cause the fragment shader to stop
                    executing. This is not necessarily the case.</p><p>Due to the way that shaders tend to work, multiple executions of the same
                    shader are often operating at the same time. All of them are running in
                    lock-step with one another; they all execute instructions at the same time, just
                    on different datasets. If one of them does a discard, it still has to keep doing
                    what it was doing, because the other three may not have discarded, since the
                    discard was based on data that may be different between each shader. This is
                    also why branches in shaders will often execute both sides rather than actually
                    branching; it keeps the shader logic simpler.</p><p>However, that does not mean <code class="literal">discard</code> is without use for
                    stopping unwanted processing. If all of the shaders that are running together
                    hit a <code class="literal">discard</code>, then they can all be aborted with no problems.
                    And hardware often does this where possible. So if there is a great deal of
                    spatial coherency with discard, this is useful.</p></div><p>The computation of the normal is based on simple trigonometry. The normal of a
                sphere does not change based on the sphere's radius. Therefore, we can compute the
                normal in the space of the mapping, which uses a normalized sphere radius of 1. The
                normal of a sphere at a point is in the same direction as the direction from the
                sphere's center to that point on the surface.</p><p>Let's look at the 2D case. To have a 2D vector direction, we need an X and Y
                coordinate. If we only have the X, but we know that the vector has a certain length,
                then we can compute the Y component of the vector based on the Pythagorean
                theorem:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e12761"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;13.2.&nbsp;Circle Point Computation</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="CirclePythagorean.svg" alt="Circle Point Computation"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="PythagoreanTheorem.svg"></div></div><p>We simply use the 3D version of this. We have X and Y from
                    <code class="varname">mapping</code>, and we know the length is 1.0. So we compute the Z
                value easily enough. And since we are only interested in the front-side of the
                sphere, we know that the Z value must be positive.</p><p>Computing the position is also easy. The position of a point on the surface of a
                sphere is the normal at that position scaled by the radius and offset by the center
                point of the sphere.</p><p>One final thing. Notice the square-root at the end, being applied to our
                accumulated lighting. This effectively simulates a gamma of 2.0, but without the
                expensive <code class="function">pow</code> function call. A <code class="function">sqrt</code> call
                is much less expensive and far more likely to be directly built into the shader
                hardware. Yes, this is not entirely accurate, since most displays simulate the 2.2
                gamma of CRT displays. But it's a lot less inaccurate than applying no correction at
                all. We'll discuss a much cheaper way to apply proper gamma correction in future
                tutorials.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tut12 Glossary.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Illumination.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut13 Correct Chicanery.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Glossary&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Correct Chicanery</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
