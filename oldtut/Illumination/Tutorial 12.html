A single light source
        illuminating a simple object hovering above flat terrain. This tutorial will demonstrate how
        to use multiple lights among a larger piece of terrain in a dynamic lighting environment. We
        will demonstrate how to properly light a scene. This is less about the artistic qualities of
        how a scene should look and more about how to make a scene look a certain way if that is how
        you desire it to look.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e11614"></a>Setting the Scene</h2></div></div></div><p>The intent for this scene is to be dynamic. The terrain will be large and hilly,
            unlike the flat plain we've seen in previous tutorials. It will use vertex colors where
            appropriate to give it terrain-like qualities. There will also be a variety of objects
            on the terrain, each with its own set of reflective characteristics. This will help show
            off the dynamic nature of the scene.</p><p>The very first step in lighting a scene is to explicitly detail what you want; without
            that, you're probably not going to find your way there. In this case, the scene is
            intended to be outdoors, so there will be a single massive directional light shining
            down. There will also be a number of smaller, weaker lights. All of these lights will
            have animated movement.</p><p>The biggest thing here is that we want the scene to dynamically change lighting
            levels. Specifically, we want a full day/night cycle. The sun will sink, gradually
            losing intensity until it has none. There, it will remain until the dawn of the next
            day, where it will gain strength and rise again. The other lights should be
            much weaker in overall intensity than the sun.</p><p>One thing that this requires is a dynamic ambient lighting range. Remember that the
            ambient light is an attempt to resolve the global illumination problem: that light
            bounces around in a scene and can therefore come from many sources. When the sun is at
            full intensity, the ambient lighting of the scene should be bright as well. This will
            mean that surfaces facing away from the sunlight will still be relatively bright, which
            is the case we see outside. When it is night, the ambient light should be virtually nil.
            Only surfaces directly facing one of the lights should be illuminated.</p><p>The <span class="propername">Scene Lighting</span> tutorial demonstrates the first
            version of attempting to replicate this scene.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e11631"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;12.1.&nbsp;Scene Lighting</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Scene%20Lighting.png" alt="Scene Lighting"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The camera is rotated and zoomed as in prior tutorials. Where this one differs is that
            the camera's target point can be moved. The <span class="keycap"><strong>W</strong></span>, <span class="keycap"><strong>A</strong></span>,
                <span class="keycap"><strong>S</strong></span>, and <span class="keycap"><strong>D</strong></span> keys move the cameras forward/backwards
            and left/right, relative to the camera's current orientation. The <span class="keycap"><strong>Q</strong></span> and
                <span class="keycap"><strong>E</strong></span> keys raise and lower the camera, again relative to its current
            orientation. Holding <span class="keycap"><strong>Shift</strong></span> with these keys will move in smaller
            increments. You can toggle viewing of the current target point by pressing
                <span class="keycap"><strong>T</strong></span>.</p><p>Because the lighting in this tutorial is very time based, there are specialized
            controls for playing with time. There are two sets of timers: one that controls the
            sun's position (as well as attributes associated with this, like the sun's intensity,
            ambient intensity, etc), and another set of timers that control the positions of other
            lights in the scene. Commands that affect timers can affect the sun only, the other
            lights only, or both at the same time.</p><p>To have timer commands affect only the sun, press <span class="keycap"><strong>2</strong></span>. To have timer
            commands affect only the other lights, press <span class="keycap"><strong>3</strong></span>. To have timer commands
            affect both, press <span class="keycap"><strong>1</strong></span>.</p><p>To rewind time by one second (of real-time), press the <span class="keycap"><strong>-</strong></span> key. To jump
            forward one second, press the <span class="keycap"><strong>=</strong></span> key. To toggle pausing, press the
                <span class="keycap"><strong>p</strong></span> key. These commands only affect the currently selected timers.
            Also, pressing the <span class="keycap"><strong>SpaceBar</strong></span> will print out the current sun-based time,
            in 24-hour notation.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e11690"></a>Materials and UBOs</h3></div></div></div><p>The source code for this tutorial is much more complicated than prior ones. Due to
                this complexity, it is spread over several files. All of the tutorial projects for
                this tutorial share the <code class="filename">Scene.h/cpp</code> and
                    <code class="filename">Lights.h/cpp</code> files. The Scene files set up the objects in
                the scene and render them. This file contains the surface properties of the
                objects.</p><p>A lighting function requires two specific sets of parameters: values that
                represent the light, and values that represent the surface. Surface properties are
                often called <em class="glossterm">material properties</em>. Each object has its own
                material properties, as defined in <code class="filename">Scene.cpp</code>.</p><p>The scene has 6 objects: the terrain, a tall cylinder in the middle, a
                multicolored cube, a sphere, a spinning tetrahedron, and a mysterious black obelisk.
                Each object has its own material properties defined by the
                    <code class="function">GetMaterials</code> function.</p><p>These properties are all stored in a uniform buffer object. We have seen these
                before for data that is shared among several programs; here, we use it to quickly
                change sets of values. These material properties do not change with time; we set
                them once and do not change them ever again. This is primarily for demonstration
                purposes, but it could have a practical effect.</p><p>Each object's material data is defined as the following struct:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e11718"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;12.1.&nbsp;Material Uniform Block</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-comment">//GLSL</span>

    <span class="code-keyword">float</span> padding[<span class="code-number">3</span>];
};</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>The <code class="varname">padding</code> variable in the C++ definition represents the fact
                that the GLSL definition of this uniform block will be padded out to a size of 12
                floats. This is due to the nature of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">std140</span>&#8221;</span> layout (feel free to read
                the appropriate section in the OpenGL specification to see why). Note the global
                definition of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">std140</span>&#8221;</span> layout; this sets all uniform blocks to use
                    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">std140</span>&#8221;</span> layout unless they specifically override it. That way, we
                do not have to write <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">layout(std140)</span>&#8221;</span> for each of the three uniform
                blocks we use in each shader file.</p><p>Also, note the use of <code class="literal">Mtl</code> at the foot of the uniform block
                definition. This is called the <em class="glossterm">instance name</em> of an interface
                block. When no instance name is specified, then the names in the uniform block are
                global. If an instance name is specified, this name must be used to qualify access
                to the names within that block. This allows us to have the <code class="literal">in vec4
                    diffuseColor</code> be separate from the material definition's
                    <code class="varname">Mtl.diffuseColor</code>.</p><p>What we want to do is put 6 material blocks in a single uniform buffer. One might
                naively think that one could simply allocate a buffer object 6 times the
                    <code class="literal">sizeof(MaterialBlock)</code>, and simply store the data as a C++
                array. Sadly, this will not work due to a UBO limitation.</p><p>When you use <code class="function">glBindBufferRange</code> to bind a UBO, OpenGL requires
                that the offset parameter, the parameter that tells where the beginning of the
                uniform block's data is within the buffer object, be aligned to a specific value.
                That is, the begining of a uniform block within a uniform buffer must be a multiple
                of a specific value. 0 works, of course, but since we have more than one block
                within a uniform buffer, they cannot all start at the buffer's beginning.</p><p>What is this value, you may ask? Welcome to the world of implementation-dependent
                values. This means that it can (and most certainly will) change depending on what
                platform you're running on. This code was tested on two different hardware
                platforms; one has a minimum alignment of 64, the other an alignment of 256.</p><p>To retrieve the implementation-dependent value, we must use a previously-unseen
                function: <code class="function">glGetIntegerv</code>. This is a function that does one
                simple thing: gets integer values from OpenGL. However, the meaning of the value
                retrieved depends on the enumerator passed as the first parameter. Basically, it's a
                way to have state retrieval functions that can easily be extended by adding new
                enumerators rather than new functions.</p><p>The code that builds the material uniform buffer is as follows:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e11775"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;12.2.&nbsp;Material UBO Construction</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-keyword">int</span> uniformBufferAlignSize = <span class="code-number">0</span>;

glBindBuffer(GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, <span class="code-number">0</span>);</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>We use <code class="function">glGetIntegerv</code> to retrieve the alignment requirement.
                Then we compute the size of a material block, plus enough padding to satisfy the
                alignment requirements. From there, it's fairly straightforward. The
                    <code class="varname">mtlBuffer</code> is just a clever way to allocate a block of memory
                without having to directly use new/delete. And yes, that is perfectly valid and
                legal C++.</p><p>When the scene is rendered, it uses <code class="function">glBindBufferRange</code> to bind

                framework library to do its job: interpolators and timers.
                    <code class="classname">Framework::Timer</code> is a generally useful class that can
                keep track of a looped range of time, converting it into a [0, 1) range. The
                interpolators are used to convert a [0, 1) range to a particular value based on a
                series of possible values. Exactly how they work is beyond the scope of this
                discussion, but some basic information will be presented.</p><p>The <code class="classname">LightManager</code> class controls all timers. It has all of
                the fast-forwarding, rewinding, and so forth controls built into it. It's basic
                functionality is to compute all of the lighting values for a particular time. It
                does this based on information given to it by the main tutorial source file,
                    <code class="filename">Scene Lighting.cpp</code>. The important values are sent in the

                intensity, and the background color. The first parameter of the struct is the time,
                on the [0, 1) range, when the parameters should have this value. A time of 0

                The other difference is that two do specular reflection computations, and the others
                do not. This represents the variety of our materials.</p><p>Overall, the code is nothing you have not seen before. We use Gaussian specular and
                an inverse-squared attenuation, in order to be as physically correct as we currently
                can be. One of the big differences is in the <code class="function">main</code>

                    <code class="classname">PerLight</code> structure does not explicitly say whether a light
                is positional or directional. However, the W component of the

                are attenuation (directional lights do not use attenuation) and how the light
                direction is computed. So we simply compute these based on the W component:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-type">vec3</span> lightDir;
<span class="code-type">vec4</span> lightIntensity;
<span class="code-keyword">if</span>(lightData.cameraSpaceLightPos.w == <span class="code-number">0.0</span>)
{
    lightDir = <span class="code-type">vec3</span>(lightData.cameraSpaceLightPos);
    lightIntensity = lightData.lightIntensity;
}
<span class="code-keyword">else</span>
{
    <span class="code-type">float</span> atten = CalcAttenuation(cameraSpacePosition,
        lightData.cameraSpaceLightPos.xyz, lightDir);
    lightIntensity = atten * lightData.lightIntensity;
}</pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e11873"></a>Lighting Problems</h3></div></div></div><p>There are a few problems with our current lighting setup. It looks (mostly) fine
                in daylight. The moving point lights have a small visual effect, but mostly they're
                not very visible. And this is what one would expect in broad daylight; flashlights
                do not make much impact in the day.</p><p>But at night, everything is exceedingly dark. The point lights, the only active
                source of illumination, are all too dim to be very visible. The terrain almost
                completely blends into the black background.</p><p>There is an alternative set of light parameters that corrects this problem. Press <span class="keycap"><strong>Shift</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>L</strong></span>; that switches to a night-time optimized version (press
                    <span class="keycap"><strong>L</strong></span> to switch back to day-optimized lighting). Here, the point
                lights provide reasonable lighting at night. The ground is still dark when facing
                away from the lights, but we can reasonably see things.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e11891"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;12.2.&nbsp;Darkness, Day vs. Night</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="DarkDayVsNight.png" alt="Darkness, Day vs. Night"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The problem is that, in daylight, the night-optimized point lights are too
                powerful. They are very visible and have very strong effects on the scene. Also,
                they cause some light problems when one of the point lights is in the right
                position. At around 12:50, find the floating white light near the cube:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e11899"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;12.3.&nbsp;Light Clipping</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Light%20Clipping.png" alt="Light Clipping"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Notice the patch of iridescent green. This is <em class="glossterm">light
                    clipping</em> or light clamping, and it is usually a very undesirable
                outcome. It happens when the computed light intensity falls outside of the [0, 1]
                range, usually in the positive direction (like in this case). The object cannot be
                shown to be brighter, so it becomes a solid color that loses all detail.</p><p>The obvious solution to our lighting problem is to simply change the point light
                intensity based on the time of day. However, this is not realistic; flashlights
                do not actually get brighter at night. So if we have to do something that
                antithetical to reality, then there's probably some aspect of reality that we are not
                properly modelling.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tut11 Glossary.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Illumination.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut12 High Dynamic Range.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Glossary&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;High Dynamic Range</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
