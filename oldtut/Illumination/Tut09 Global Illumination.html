For
            example, take this image:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e9415"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;9.10.&nbsp;Half Lit</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="No%20Ambient.png" alt="Half Lit"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The unlit portions of the cylinder are completely, 100% black. This almost never
            happens in real life, even for objects we perceive as being <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">black</span>&#8221;</span> in
            color. The reason for this is somewhat complicated.</p><p>Consider a scene of the outdoors. In normal daylight, there is exactly one light
            source: the sun. Objects that are in direct sunlight appear to be bright, and objects
            that have some object between them and the sun are in shadow.</p><p>But think about what those shadows look like. They're not 100% black. They're
            certainly darker than the surrounding area, but they still have some color. And
            remember: we only see anything because our eyes detect light. In order to see an object
            in the shadow of a light source, that object must either be emitting light directly or
            reflecting light that came from somewhere else. Grass is not known for its
            light-emitting qualities, so where does the light come from?</p><p>Think about it. We see because an object reflects light into our eyes. But our eyes
            are not special; the object does not reflect light <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> into our
            eyes. It reflects light in all directions. Not necessarily at the same intensity in each
            direction, but objects that reflect light tend to do so in all directions to some
            degree. What happens when that light hits another surface?</p><p>The same thing that happens when light hits any surface: some of it is absorbed, and
            some is reflected in some way.</p><p>The light being cast in shadows from the sun comes from many places. Part of it is an
            atmospheric effect; the sun is so bright that the weakly reflective atmosphere reflects
            enough light to shine a color. Typically, this is a pale blue. Part of the light comes
            from other objects. The sun gives off so much light that the light reflected from other
            objects is bright enough to be a substantial contributer to the overall lighting in a
            scene.</p><p>This phenomenon is called <em class="glossterm">interreflection.</em> A lighting model
            that handles interreflection is said to handle <em class="glossterm">global
                illumination.</em> It represents light that bounces from object to object
            before hitting the eyes of the person viewing the scene. Modelling only lighting
            directly from a light-emitting surface is called <em class="glossterm">local
                illumination</em> or <em class="glossterm">direct illumination,</em> and it is
            what we have been doing up until this point.</p><p>As you might imagine, modelling global illumination is hard. <span class="emphasis"><em>Very</em></span>
            hard. It is typically a subtle effect, but in many scenes, particularly outdoor scenes,
            it is almost a necessity to provide at least basic global illumination modelling in
            order to achieve a decent degree of photorealism. Incidentally, this is a good part of
            the reason why most games tend to avoid outdoor scenes or light outdoor scenes as though
            the sky were cloudy or overcast. This neatly avoids needing to do complex global
            illumination modelling by damping down the brightness of the sun to levels when
            interreflection would be difficult to notice.</p><p>Having this completely black area in our rendering looks incredibly fake. Since doing
            actual global illumination modelling is hard, we will instead use a time-tested
            technique: <em class="glossterm">ambient lighting.</em></p><p>The ambient lighting <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">model</span>&#8221;</span><sup>[<a name="d0e9466" href="#ftn.d0e9466" class="footnote">6</a>]</sup> is quite simple. It assumes that, on every object in the scene, there is a
            light of a certain intensity that emanates from everywhere. It comes from all directions
            equally, so there is no angle of incidence in our diffuse calculation. It is simply the
            ambient light intensity * the diffuse surface color.</p><p>We do this in the <span class="propername">Ambient Lighting</span> tutorial. The
            controls are the same as the last tutorial, except that the space bar swaps between the
            two cylinders (red and white), and that the <span class="keycap"><strong>T</strong></span> key toggles ambient
            lighting on and off (defaults to off).</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e9481"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;9.11.&nbsp;Ambient Lighting</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Ambient%20Lighting.png" alt="Ambient Lighting"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The detail seen in the dark portion of the cylinder only comes from the diffuse color.
            And because the ambient is fairly weak, the diffuse color of the surface appears muted
            in the dark areas.</p><p>The rendering code now uses four of vertex shaders instead of two. Two of them are
            used for non-ambient lighting, and use the same shaders we have seen before, and the
            other two use ambient lighting.</p><p>The ambient vertex shader that uses per-vertex colors is called

            the diffuse lighting, and the other for the ambient lighting. The only other change is
            to the last line in the shader. The usual diffuse lighting result has its value added to
