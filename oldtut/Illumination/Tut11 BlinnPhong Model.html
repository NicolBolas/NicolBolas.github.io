            greater than 90 degrees, can be solved by changing the computation. This modified model
            is called the <em class="glossterm">Blinn-Phong specular model</em> or just the
                <em class="glossterm">Blinn specular model.</em></p><p>It is no more physically correct than the Phong model. But it does tend to account for
            more than Phong.</p><p>The main problem with Phong is that the angle between the view direction and the
            reflection direction has to be less than 90 degrees in order for the specular term to be
            non-zero.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e11097"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;11.7.&nbsp;Large View and Reflect Angle</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="PhongReflectDirTooGreat.svg" alt="Large View and Reflect Angle"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The angle between V and R is greater than 90 degrees. Cases like this are not modeled
            correctly by Phong. There could be microfacets at the point which are oriented towards
            the camera, but Phong cannot properly model this. The problem is that the dot product
            between the view direction and reflection direction can be negative, which does not lead
            to a reasonable result when passed through the rest of the equation.</p><p>The Blinn model uses a different set of vectors for its computations, one that are
            less than 90 degrees in all valid cases. The Blinn model requires computing the
                <em class="glossterm">half-angle vector</em>. The half-angle vector is the direction
            halfway between the view direction and the light position.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e11110"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;11.8.&nbsp;Geometric Half-Angle Vector</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="HalfangleVectorDiagram.svg" alt="Geometric Half-Angle Vector"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><div class="equation"><a name="d0e11116"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;11.3.&nbsp;Half-Angle Vector</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="HalfAngleVector.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>When the view direction is perfectly aligned with the reflected direction, the
            half-angle vector is perfectly aligned with the surface normal. Or to put it another
            way, the half-angle is the direction the surface normal would need to be facing in order
            for the viewer to see a specular reflection from the light source.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e11124"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;11.9.&nbsp;Perfect Reflection Half-Angle Vector</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="HalfangleVectorPerfect.svg" alt="Perfect Reflection Half-Angle Vector"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>So instead of comparing the reflection vector to the view direction, the Blinn model
            compares the half-angle vector to the surface normal. It then raises this value to a
            power representing the shininess of the surface.</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e11132"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;11.4.&nbsp;Blinn Specular Term</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="BlinnTerm.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>The angle between the half-angle vector and the normal is always less than 90 degrees.
            So the Blinn specular model produces similar results to the Phong model, but without
            some of Phong's problems. This is demonstrated in the <span class="propername">Blinn vs
                Phong Lighting</span> tutorial.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e11143"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;11.10.&nbsp;Blinn Lighting</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Blinn%20Lighting.png" alt="Blinn Lighting"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The controls are similar to the last tutorial. Pressing the <span class="keycap"><strong>H</strong></span> key
            will switch between Blinn and Phong specular. Pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>Shift</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>H</strong></span> will switch between diffuse+specular and specular only. Because the specular
            exponents have different meanings between the two lighting models, each model has a
            separate exponent. The keys for changing the exponent values will only change the value
            for the lighting model currently being viewed.</p><p>The real work here is, as before, in the shader computations. Here is the main code
            for computing the diffuse + Blinn illumination.</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e11162"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;11.2.&nbsp;Blinn-Phong Lighting Shader</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-type">vec3</span> lightDir = <span class="code-type">vec3</span>(<span class="code-number">0.0</span>);

            In general, to produce a highlight the same size as a Phong one, you will need a larger
            Blinn exponent. Play around with the different exponents, to get a feel for what Blinn
            and Phong can and cannot achieve.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e11181"></a>Hard Specular Edge</h3></div></div></div><p>There are still a few artifacts in the rendering. For example, if you arrange the
                light, object, and camera as follows, you can see this:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e11186"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;11.12.&nbsp;Light Edge</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="FalseEdge.png" alt="Light Edge"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The cylinder looks like it has a very sharp corner. What causes this? It is caused
                by this line in the shader:</p><pre class="programlisting">blinnTerm = cosAngIncidence != <span class="code-number">0.0</span> ? blinnTerm : <span class="code-number">0.0</span>;</pre><p>If the angle between the normal and the light direction is greater than 90
                degrees, then we force the specular term to zero. The reason behind this is very
                simple: we assume our surface is a closed object. Given that assumption, if the
                normal at a location on the surface is facing away from the light, then this could
                only happen if there is some other part of the surface between itself and the light.
                Therefore, the surface cannot be directly illuminated by that light.</p><p>That is a reasonable assumption, and it certainly makes sense in reality. But
                real-life objects don't have these kinds of hard specular lines. So what are we
                missing in our model?</p><p>What we are missing is that point lights don't exist in the real world. Light
                illumination does not come from a single, infinitely small location in space. Even
                the size of the Sun relative to Earth has a significant area. So what this means is
                that, for a given point on a surface, it could be in partial view of the light
                source. Imagine Earth at sunset for an example: part of the sun is below the horizon
                and part of it is not.</p><p>Since only part of the light is visible from that point on the surface, then only
                part of the light contributes to the overall illumination. So at these places where
                you might get hard specular boundaries, under more real lighting conditions, you
                still get a semi-gentle fall-off.</p><p>That's all well and good, but modeling true area lights is difficult even for
                simple cases. A much simpler way to resolve this is to not use such a low specular
                exponent. This specular exponent is relatively small, leading to a very broad
                specular highlight. If we restrict our use of a specular term to surfaces who's
                specular exponent is reasonably large, we can prevent this artifact from
                appearing.</p><p>Here is the same scene, but with a larger exponent:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e11208"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;11.13.&nbsp;Improved Light Edge</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="LessFalseEdge.png" alt="Improved Light Edge"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>We could also adjust the specular reflectance, so that surfaces with a low
                specular exponent also have a small specular reflectance.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tut11 Phong Model.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Tutorial 11.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut11 Gaussian.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Phong Model&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Gaussian</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
