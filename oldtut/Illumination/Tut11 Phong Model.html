            The distribution of microfacets is not determined by a real statistical distribution.
            Instead it is determined by... making things up.</p><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>On Phong and Nomenclature</b></p><p>The term <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Phong shading</span>&#8221;</span> was once commonly used to refer to what we
                now know as per-fragment (or per-pixel) lighting. That is, evaluating the lighting
                equation at every fragment over a surface. This term should not be confused with the
                Phong specular lighting model. Because of this, the term <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Phong
                    shading</span>&#8221;</span> has fallen out of common usage.</p></div><p>The Phong model is not really based on anything real. It does not deal in microfacet
            distributions at all. What the Phong model is is something that looks decent enough and
            is cheap to compute. It approximates a statistical distribution of microfacets, but it
            is not really based on anything real.</p><p>The Phong model states that the light reflected in the direction of the viewer varies
            based on the angle between difference between the view direction and the direction of
            perfect reflection. Mathematically, the Phong model looks like this:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e10874"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;11.1.&nbsp;Phong Specular Term</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="PhongTerm.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>The Phong term is multiplied by the light intensity in the lighting equation.</p><p>The brightness of the specular highlight for a particular viewing direction is based
            on raising the cosine of the angle between the view direction and the reflection
            direction to a power. As previously stated, this model is not based on anything real. It
            simply creates a bright somewhat-circular area on the surface. This area gets dimmer as
            the viewer is farther from the direction of perfect reflection.</p><p>The <code class="varname">s</code> term in the equation represents the roughness of the surface.
            A smooth surface, which should have a smaller highlight, has a large
                <code class="varname">s</code>. Since the cosine of the angle is a number on [0, 1], taking it
            to a power greater than 1.0 will make the number smaller. Therefore, a large
                <code class="varname">s</code> exponent will make for a small highlight.</p><p>The specular exponent can range from (0, &#8734;). A small exponent makes for a rougher
            appearance, while a large exponent suggests a shiny surface.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e10897"></a>Specular Absorption</h3></div></div></div><p>The Phong term computed above is then multiplied with the light intensity. This
                represents the maximum light reflected along the view direction.</p><p>However, just as with diffuse lighting, surfaces can absorb some quantity of the
                light that would be specularly reflected. We could use the diffuse color here,
                multiplying it by the specular term. But this would not be physically correct for
                many kinds of objects.</p><p>Many surfaces, particularly certain man-made pigments and plastics, have multiple
                layers to them. The top layer will specularly reflect some portion of the light.
                However, it will also let some portion of that light reach lower layers. These
                layers have stronger diffuse reflectance. So the specular absorption on the surface
                has different characteristics than the diffuse absorption in the lower layers.
                Usually, the specular layer reflects equally on all wavelenths, so the specular
                highlight tends to be the color of the light itself.</p><p>Notably, metals do not do this. Their diffuse absorption tends to be the same as
                their specular absorption. So while blue plastic under white light has a white
                specular highlight, gold metal under white light has a gold highlight.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e10908"></a>Drawing Phong</h3></div></div></div><p>The <span class="propername">Phong Lighting</span> tutorial demonstrates the

Clicking and
                dragging with the right mouse button controls the orientation of the cylinder.
                Pressing the <span class="keycap"><strong>T</strong></span> key will swap between the scaled and unscaled
                cylinder. The <span class="keycap"><strong>Y</strong></span> key toggles the drawing of the light source. The
                    <span class="keycap"><strong>B</strong></span> key will toggle the light's rotation on/off. Pressing the
                    <span class="keycap"><strong>Space Bar</strong></span> toggles between drawing the uncolored cylinder and
                the colored one.</p><p>The light's position is mostly controlled as before, with the
                    <span class="keycap"><strong>I</strong></span>,<span class="keycap"><strong>J</strong></span>, <span class="keycap"><strong>K</strong></span>, and
                    <span class="keycap"><strong>L</strong></span> keys. The specular value is controlled by the
                    <span class="keycap"><strong>U</strong></span> and <span class="keycap"><strong>O</strong></span> keys. They raise and low the specular
                exponent. Using <span class="keycap"><strong>Shift</strong></span> in combination with them will raise/lower the
                exponent by smaller amounts.</p><p>The <span class="keycap"><strong>G</strong></span> key toggles between a diffuse color of (1, 1, 1) and a
                darker diffuse color of (0.2, 0.2, 0.2). This is useful for seeing what the specular
                would look like on a darker surface color.</p><p>The <span class="keycap"><strong>H</strong></span> key selects between specular and diffuse, just specular and
                just diffuse. The ambient term is always used. Pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>Shift</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>H</strong></span> will toggle between diffuse only and diffuse+specular.</p><p>The rendering code is nothing you have not seen in earlier tutorials. It loads 6
                programs, and uses the various controls to select which to use to render.</p><p>There are two vertex shaders in use. One that takes the position and normal
                attributes, and one that takes them plus a per-vertex color. Both of them output the
                camera-space vertex normal (computed with a normal matrix), the camera-space vertex
                position, and the diffuse color. In the case of the shader that does not take a
                per-vertex color, the diffuse color output is taken from a uniform set by the
                code.</p><p>The fragment shaders are more interesting. They do lighting in camera space, so
                there is no need for the reverse-transform trick we used previously. The shaders
                also use light attenuation, but it only varies with the inverse of the distance,
                rather than the inverse squared.</p><p>The main portion of the specular+diffuse fragment shader is as follows:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e10983"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;11.1.&nbsp;Phong Lighting Shader</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-type">vec3</span> lightDir = <span class="code-type">vec3</span>(<span class="code-number">0.0</span>);

outputColor = (diffuseColor * attenIntensity * cosAngIncidence) +
    (specularColor * attenIntensity * phongTerm) +
    (diffuseColor * ambientIntensity);</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>The initial section of code should be familiar. The Phong specular computations
                start with computing the direction to the camera. Since we are working in camera
                space, we know that the camera is at the origin (0, 0, 0). The direction from point
                A to point B is the normalization of B - A. Since the destination point is at the
                origin, that becomes simply -A, normalized.</p><p>The next line computes the direction of perfect reflection, given the light
                direction and the surface normal. The function here, <code class="function">reflect</code>,
                is a standard GLSL function used for precisely this purpose. Notice that the
                function in question requires the that the light direction is the direction
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>from</em></span> the light. Our light direction is the direction to the
                light. This is why it is negated.</p><p>This function is useful, but it is important to know how to compute the reflection
                direction on your own. Here is the formula:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e11000"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;11.2.&nbsp;Vector Reflection</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="ReflectionVector.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>The L vector is the direction to the light, so negating it produces the vector
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>from</em></span> the light.</p><p>From here, the Phong term is computed by taking the dot product of the reflection
                direction and the view direction, clamping it to 0, 1. The next line, where we use
                the angle of incidence, is very important. What this line does is prevent us from
                having a specular term when the surface normal is oriented away from the light. If
                this line were not here, it would be possible to have specular highlights appear to
                shine <span class="emphasis"><em>through</em></span> a surface. Which is not particularly
                realistic.</p><p>The GLSL standard function <code class="function">pow</code> is next used to raise the
                Phong term to the power. This function seems generally useful, but it has a large
                number of limitations. The <code class="function">pow</code> function computes <span class="mathphrase">X<sup>Y</sup></span>, where X is the first parameter and Y is the second.</p><p>This function only works for values of X that are greater than or equal to 0; it
                returns undefined values (ie: anything) otherwise. Clamping the Phong term ensures
                this. Also, if X is exactly 0.0, then Y must be strictly greater than zero;
                undefined values are returned otherwise. These limitations exist to make computing
                the power function much faster.</p><p>And for Phong specular computations, the limitations almost never come into play.
                The cosine of the angle is clamped, and the specular exponent is not allowed to be
                zero.</p><p>Notice that the specular term is added into the diffuse and ambient terms. This
                has meaning for the intensity issue we have seen before. If the diffuse and specular
                colors are too large, and the light attenuation is quite small, then the resulting
                values from the lighting equations can be larger than 1.0 in magnitude. Since OpenGL
                automatically clamps the colors to 1.0, this can cause unpleasant effects, where
                there appears to be a very bright, white area on a surface.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e11036"></a>Visual Specular</h3></div></div></div><p>Having even a weak specular term can make a significant, if subtle, difference. In
                our case, the specular color of the material is a fairly weak (0.25, 0.25, 0.25).
                But even with a rough specular highlight, the surface looks more physically
                reasonable.</p><p>In particular, it is interesting to note what happens when you use a very dark
                diffuse color. You can activate this by pressing the <span class="keycap"><strong>G</strong></span> key.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e11046"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;11.4.&nbsp;Phong with Dark Diffuse</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Phong%20Dark%20Diffuse.png" alt="Phong with Dark Diffuse"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>If there was no specular term at all, you would see very little.. The specular
                highlight, even with the fairly weak specular reflection of 0.25, is strong enough
                to give some definition to the object when seen from various angles. This more
                accurately shows what a black plastic object might look like.</p><p>One thing you may notice is that, if you bring the light close to the surface, the
                specular area tends to have very sharp edges.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e11056"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;11.5.&nbsp;Phong Clipping</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Phong%20Clipping.png" alt="Phong Clipping"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>This is part of the nature of specular reflections. If the light is almost
                perpendicular to the surface, the specular reflection will shine brightest when the
                light is almost eclipsed by the surface. This creates a strong discontinuity at the
                point where the light is no longer in view.</p><p>You generally see this most with rough surfaces (small exponents). With smoother
                surfaces, this is rarely seen. But this is not the only visual oddity with Phong and
                having small exponents.</p><p>If you drop the exponent down to the minimum value the code will allow, you will
                see something like this:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e11068"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;11.6.&nbsp;Phong Distortion</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Phong%20Distortion.png" alt="Phong Distortion"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>This ring area shows one of the main limitations of the Phong model. When trying
                to depict a surface that is rough but still has specular highlights, the Phong model
                starts to break down. It will not allow any specular contribution from areas outside
                of a certain region.</p><p>This region comes from the angle between the reflection direction and the view
                direction. This area is the region where the reflection direction and view direction
                are more than 90 degrees apart.</p><p>Under the microfacet model, there is still some chance that some microfacets are
                oriented towards the camera, even if reflection direction is pointed sharply away.
                Thus, there should be at least some specular contribution from those areas. The
                Phong model cannot allow this, due to how it is computed.</p><p>What all this tells us is that Phong works best with larger exponents. Small
                exponents show its problems and limitations.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tutorial 11.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Tutorial 11.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut11 BlinnPhong Model.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;11.&nbsp;Shinies&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Blinn-Phong Model</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
