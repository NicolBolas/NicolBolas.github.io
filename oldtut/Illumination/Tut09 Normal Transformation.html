            incidence has certain requirements. Namely, that the two vectors involved, the surface
            normal and the light direction, are of unit length. The light direction can be assumed
            to be of unit length, since it is passed directly as a uniform.</p><p>The surface normal can also be assumed to be of unit length.
                <span class="emphasis"><em>Initially.</em></span> However, the normal undergoes a transformation by an
            arbitrary matrix; there is no guarantee that this transformation will not apply scaling
            or other transformations to the vector that will result in a non-unit vector.</p><p>Of course, it is easy enough to correct this. The GLSL function
                <code class="function">normalize</code> will return a vector that is of unit length without
            changing the direction of the input vector.</p><p>And while mathematically this would function, geometrically, it would be nonsense. For
            example, consider a 2D circle. We can apply a non-uniform scale (different scales in
            different axes) to the positions on this circle that will transform it into an
            ellipse:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e9287"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;9.7.&nbsp;Circle Scaling</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="CircleScaling.svg" alt="Circle Scaling"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>This is all well and good, but consider the normals in this transformation:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e9295"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;9.8.&nbsp;Circle Scaling with Normals</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="CircleNormalScaling.svg" alt="Circle Scaling with Normals"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The ellipse in the middle has the normals that you would expect if you transformed the
            normals from the circle by the same matrix the circle was transformed by. They may be
            unit length, but they no longer reflect the <span class="emphasis"><em>shape</em></span> of the ellipse.
            The ellipse on the right has normals that reflect the actual shape.</p><p>It turns out that, what you really want to do is transform the normals with the same
            rotations as the positions, but invert the scales. That is, a scale of 0.5 along the X
            axis will shrink positions in that axis by half. For the surface normals, you want to
                <span class="emphasis"><em>double</em></span> the X value of the normals, then normalize the
            result.</p><p>This is easy if you have a simple matrix. But more complicated matrices, composed from
            multiple successive rotations, scales, and other operations, are not so easy to
            compute.</p><p>Instead, what we must do is compute something called the <em class="glossterm">inverse
                transpose</em> of the matrix in question. This means we first compute the
            inverse matrix, then compute the <em class="glossterm">transpose</em> of that matrix. The
            transpose of a matrix is simply the same matrix flipped along the diagonal. The columns
            of the original matrix are the rows of its transpose. That is:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e9321"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;9.4.&nbsp;Matrix Transpose</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="MatrixTranspose.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>So how does this inverse transpose help us?</p><p>Remember: what we want is to invert the scales of our matrix without affecting the
            rotational characteristics of our matrix. Given a 3x3 matrix M that is composed of only
            rotation and scale transformations, we can re-express this matrix as follows:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="MatrixSVD.svg"></div></div><p>That is, the matrix can be expressed as doing a rotation into a space, followed by a
            single scale transformation, followed by another rotation. We can do this
                <span class="emphasis"><em>regardless</em></span> of how many scale and rotation matrices were used to
            build M. That is, M could be the result of twenty rotation and scale matrices, but all
            of those can be extracted into two rotations with a scale inbetween.<sup>[<a name="d0e9340" href="#ftn.d0e9340" class="footnote">5</a>]</sup></p><p>Recall that what we want to do is invert the scales in our transformation. Where we
            scale by 0.4 in the original, we want to scale by 2.5 in the inverse. The inverse matrix
            of a pure scale matrix is a matrix with each of the scaling components inverted.
            Therefore, we can express the matrix that we actually want as this:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="InvertedScale.svg"></div></div><p>An interesting fact about pure-rotation matrices: the inverse of any rotation matrix
                <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> its transpose. Also, taking the inverse of a matrix twice
            results in the original matrix. Therefore, you can express any pure-rotation matrix as
            the inverse transpose of itself, without affecting the matrix. Since the inverse is its
            transpose, and doing a transpose twice on a matrix does not change its value, the
            inverse-transpose of a rotation matrix is a no-op.</p><p>Also, since the values in pure-scale matrices are along the diagonal, a transpose
            operation on scale matrices does nothing. With these two facts in hand, we can
            re-express the matrix we want to compute as:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="DeriveInvTrans_1.svg"></div></div><p>Using matrix algebra, we can factor the transposes out, but doing so requires
            reversing the order of the matrix multiplication:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="FactorOutTranspose_2.svg"></div></div><p>Similar, we can factor out the inverse operations, but this requires reversing the
            order again:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="FactorOutInverse_3.svg"></div></div><p>Thus, the inverse-transpose solves our problem. And both GLM and GLSL have nice
            functions that can do these operations for us. Though really, if you can avoid doing an
            inverse-transpose in GLSL, you are <span class="emphasis"><em>strongly</em></span> advised to do so; this
            is not a trivial computation.</p><p>We do this in the <span class="propername">Scale and Lighting</span> tutorial. It
            controls mostly the same as the previous tutorial, with a few exceptions. Pressing the
            space bar will toggle between a regular cylinder and a scaled one. The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">T</span>&#8221;</span>
            key will toggle between properly using the inverse-transpose (the default) and not using
            the inverse transpose. The rendering code for the cylinder is as follows:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e9389"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;9.5.&nbsp;Lighting with Proper Normal Transform</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">glutil::PushStack push(modelMatrix);

Doing the inverse-transpose is only really
            necessary if you are using a <span class="emphasis"><em>non-uniform</em></span> scale. In practice, it's
            actually somewhat rare to use this kind of scale factor. We do it in these tutorials, so
            that it is easier to build models from simple geometric components. But when you have an
            actual modeller creating objects for a specific purpose, non-uniform scales generally
            are not used. At least, not in the output mesh. It's better to just get the modeller to
            adjust the model as needed in their modelling application.</p><p>Uniform scales are more commonly used. So you still need to normalize the normal after
            transforming it with the model-to-camera matrix, even if you are not using the
            inverse-transpose.</p><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a name="ftn.d0e9340" href="#d0e9340" class="para">5</a>] </sup>We will skip over deriving how exactly this is true. If you are interested,
