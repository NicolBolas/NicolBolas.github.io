Unfortunately, the visual
            results are not.</p><p>For example, use the controls to display the position of the point light source, then
            position it near the ground plane. See anything wrong?</p><p>If everything were working correctly, one would expect to see a bright area directly
            under the light. After all, geometrically, this situation looks like this:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e9940"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;10.2.&nbsp;Light Near Surface</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="LightNearSurface.svg" alt="Light Near Surface"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The surface normal for the areas directly under the light are almost the same as the
            direction towards the light. This means that the angle of incidence is small, so the
            cosine of this angle is close to 1. That should translate to having a bright area under
            the light, but darker areas farther away. What we see is nothing of the sort. Why is
            that?</p><p>Well, consider what we are doing. We are computing the lighting at every triangle's
                <span class="emphasis"><em>vertex</em></span>, and then interpolating the results across the surface
            of the triangle. The ground plane is made up of precisely four vertices: the four
            corners. And those are all very far from the light position and have a very large angle
            of incidence. Since none of them have a small angle of incidence, none of the colors
            that are interpolated across the surface are bright.</p><p>You can see this is evident by putting the light position next to the cylinder. If the
            light is at the top or bottom of the cylinder, then the area near the light will be
            bright. But if you move the light to the middle of the cylinder, far the top or bottom
            vertices, then the illumination will be much dimmer.</p><p>This is not the only problem with doing per-vertex lighting. For example, run the
            tutorial again and do not move the light. Just watch how the light behaves on the
            cylinder's surface as it animates around. Unlike with directional lighting, you can very
            easily see the triangles on the cylinder's surface. Though the per-vertex computations
            are not helping matters, the main problem here has to do with interpolating the
            values.</p><p>If you move the light source farther away, you can see that the triangles smooth out
            and become indistinct from one another. But this is simply because, if the light source
            is far enough away, the results are indistinguishable from a directional light. Each
            vertex's direction to the light is almost the same as each other vertex's direction to
            the light.</p><p>Per-vertex lighting was reasonable when dealing with directional lights. But it simply
            is not a good idea for point lighting. The question arises: why was per-vertex lighting
            good with directional lights to begin with?</p><p>Remember that our diffuse lighting equation has two parameters: the direction to the
            light and the surface normal. In directional lighting, the direction to the light is
            always the same. Therefore, the only value that changes over a triangle's surface is the
            surface normal.</p><p>Linear interpolation of vectors looks like this:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="StandardLerp_1.svg"></div></div><p>The &#945; in the equation is the factor of interpolation between the two values. When &#945; is
            one, we get V<sub>a</sub>, and when it is zero, we get
                V<sub>b</sub>. The two values, V<sub>a</sub> and
                V<sub>b</sub> can be scalars or vectors.</p><p>Our diffuse lighting equation is this:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="DiffuseLightEq_2.svg"></div></div><p>If the surface normal N is being interpolated, then at any particular point on the
            surface, we get this equation for a directional light (the light direction L does not
            change):</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="LerpDiffuse_3.svg"></div></div><p>The dot product is distributive, like scalar multiplication. So we can distribute the
            L to both sides of the dot product term:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="LerpDiffuse_4.svg"></div></div><p>We can extract the linear terms from the dot product. Remember that the dot product is
            the cosine of the angle between two vectors, times the length of those vectors. The two
            scaling terms directly modify the length of the vectors. So they can be pulled out to
            give us:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="LerpDiffuse_5.svg"></div></div><p>Recall that vector/scalar multiplication is distributive. We can distribute the
            multiplication by the diffuse color and light intensity to both terms. This gives
            us:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="LerpDiffuse_6.svg"></div></div><p>This means that if L is constant, linearly interpolating N is exactly equivalent to
            linearly interpolating the results of the lighting equation. And the addition of the
            ambient term does not change this, since it is a constant and would not be affected by
            linear interpolation.</p><p>When doing point lighting, you would have to interpolate both N and L. And that does
            not yield the same results as linearly interpolating the two colors you get from the
            lighting equation. This is a big part of the reason why the cylinder does not look
            correct.</p><p>The more physically correct method of lighting is to perform lighting at every rendered
            pixel. To do that, we would have to interpolate the lighting parameters across the
            triangle, and perform the lighting computation in the fragment shader.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tutorial 10.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Tutorial 10.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut10 Fragment Lighting.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Plane Lights&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Fragment Lighting</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
