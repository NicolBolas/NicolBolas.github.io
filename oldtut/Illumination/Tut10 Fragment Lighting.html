            light direction and normal, instead of just the results of the lighting equation. This
            is called per-fragment lighting or just <em class="glossterm">fragment lighting.</em></p><p>This is pretty simple, conceptually. We simply need to do the lighting computations in
            the fragment shader. So the fragment shader needs the position of the fragment, the
            light's position (or the direction to the light from that position), and the surface
            normal of the fragment at that position. And all of these values need to be in the same
            coordinate space.</p><p>There is a problem that needs to be dealt with first. Normals do not interpolate well.
            Or rather, wildly different normals do not interpolate well. And light directions can be
            very different if the light source is close to the triangle relative to that triangle's
            size.</p><p>Consider the large plane we have. The direction toward the light will be very
            different at each vertex, so long as our light remains in relatively close proximity to
            the plane.</p><p>Part of the problem is with interpolating values along the diagonal of our triangle.
            Interpolation within a triangle works like this. For any position within the area of the
            triangle, that position can be expressed as a weighted sum of the positions of the three
            vertices.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e10035"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;10.3.&nbsp;Triangle Interpolation</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="BarycentricTriangle.svg" alt="Triangle Interpolation"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><div class="informalequation"><span class="mathphrase">P = &#945;A + &#946;B + &#947;C, where &#945; + &#946; + &#947; = 1.0</span></div><p>The &#945;, &#946;, and &#947; values are not the distances from their respective points to the point
            of interest. In the above case, the point P is in the exact center of the triangle.
            Thus, the three values are each &#8531;.</p><p>If the point of interest is along an edge of the triangle, then the contribution of
            the vertex not sharing that edge is zero.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e10048"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;10.4.&nbsp;Triangle Edge Interpolation</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="BarycentricTriangleEdge.svg" alt="Triangle Edge Interpolation"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Here, point P is exactly halfway between points C and B. Therefore,  &#946;, and &#947; are both
            0.5, but &#945; is 0.0. If point P is anywhere along the edge of a triangle, it gets none of
            its final interpolated value from the third vertex. So along a triangle's edge, it acts
            like the kind of linear interpolation we have seen before.</p><p>This is how OpenGL interpolates the vertex shader outputs. It takes the &#945;, &#946;, and &#947;
            coordinates for the fragment's position and combines them with the vertex output value
            for the three vertices in the same way it does for the fragment's position. There is
            slightly more to it than that, but we will discuss that later.</p><p>The ground plane in our example is made of two large triangles. They look like
            this:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e10060"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;10.5.&nbsp;Two Triangle Quadrilateral</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="TwoTriangleQuad.svg" alt="Two Triangle Quadrilateral"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>What happens if we put the color black on the top-right and bottom-left points, and
            put the color green on the top-left and bottom-right points? If you interpolate these
            across the surface, you would get this:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e10068"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;10.6.&nbsp;Two Triangle Interpolation</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="TwoTriangleInterpolation.svg" alt="Two Triangle Interpolation"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The color is pure green along the diagonal. That is because along a triangle's edge,
            the value interpolated will only be the color of the two vertices along that edge. The
            value is interpolated based only on each triangle individually, not on extra data from
            another neighboring triangle.</p><p>In our case, this means that for points along the main diagonal, the light direction
            will only be composed of the direction values from the two vertices on that diagonal.
            This is not good. This would not be much of a problem if the light direction did not
            change much along the surface, but with large triangles (relative to how close the light
            is to them), that is simply not the case.</p><p>Since we cannot interpolate the light direction very well, we need to interpolate
            something else. Something that does exhibit the characteristics we need when
            interpolated.</p><p>Positions interpolate quite well. Interpolating the top-left position and bottom-right
            positions gets an accurate position value along the diagonal. So instead of
            interpolating the light direction, we interpolate the components of the light direction.
            Namely, the two positions. The light position is a constant, so we only need to
            interpolate the vertex position.</p><p>Now, we could do this in any space. But for illustrative purposes, we will be doing
            this in model space. That is, both the light position and vertex position will be in
            model space.</p><p>One of the advantages of doing things in model space is that it gets rid of that pesky
            matrix inverse/transpose we had to do to transform normals correctly. Indeed, normals
            are not transformed at all. One of the disadvantages is that it requires computing an
            inverse matrix for our light position, so that we can go from world space to model
            space.</p><p>The <span class="propername">Fragment Point Lighting</span> tutorial shows off how
            fragment lighting works.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e10091"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;10.7.&nbsp;Fragment Point Lighting</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Fragment%20Point%20Lighting.png" alt="Fragment Point Lighting"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Much better.</p><p>This tutorial is controlled as before, with a few exceptions. Pressing the
                <span class="keycap"><strong>t</strong></span> key will toggle a scale factor onto to be applied to the
            cylinder, and pressing the <span class="keycap"><strong>h</strong></span> key will toggle between per-fragment
            lighting and per-vertex lighting.</p><p>The rendering code has changed somewhat, considering the use of model space for
            lighting instead of camera space. The start of the rendering looks as follows:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e10109"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;10.3.&nbsp;Initial Per-Fragment Rendering</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">glutil::MatrixStack modelMatrix;
modelMatrix.SetMatrix(g_viewPole.CalcMatrix());

<span class="code-keyword">const</span> glm::vec4 &amp;worldLightPos = CalcLightPosition();

glm::vec4 lightPosCameraSpace = modelMatrix.Top() * worldLightPos;</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>The new code is the last line, where we transform the world-space light into camera
            space. This is done to make the math much easier. Since our matrix stack is building up
            the transform from model to camera space, the inverse of this matrix would be a
            transform from camera space to model space. So we need to put our light position into
            camera space before we transform it by the inverse.</p><p>After doing that, it uses a variable to switch between per-vertex and per-fragment
            lighting. This just selects which shaders to use; both sets of shaders take the same
            uniform values, even though they use them in different program stages.</p><p>The ground plane is rendered with this code:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e10120"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;10.4.&nbsp;Ground Plane Per-Fragment Rendering</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">glutil::PushStack push(modelMatrix);

glm::value_ptr(modelMatrix.Top()));

glm::mat4 invTransform = glm::inverse(modelMatrix.Top());
glm::vec4 lightPosModelSpace = invTransform * lightPosCameraSpace;
glUniform3fv(pWhiteProgram-&gt;modelSpaceLightPosUnif, <span class="code-number">1</span>, glm::value_ptr(lightPosModelSpace));

g_pPlaneMesh-&gt;Render();
glUseProgram(<span class="code-number">0</span>);</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>We compute the inverse matrix using <code class="function">glm::inverse</code> and store it.
            Then we use that to compute the model space light position and pass that to the shader.
            Then the plane is rendered.</p><p>The cylinder is rendered using similar code. It simply does a few transformations to
            the model matrix before computing the inverse and rendering.</p><p>The shaders are where the real action is. As with previous lighting tutorials, there
            are two sets of shaders: one that take a per-vertex color, and one that uses a constant
            white color. The vertex shaders that do per-vertex lighting computations should be
            familiar:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e10134"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;10.5.&nbsp;Model Space Per-Vertex Lighting Vertex Shader</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">#version <span class="code-number">330</span>

                the light inside the cylinder.

This are reminiscent of the same
                interpolation problem we had before. Was not doing lighting at the fragment level
                supposed to fix this?</p><p>It is similar to the original problem, but technically different. Per-vertex
                lighting caused lines because of color interpolation artifacts. This is caused by an
                optical illusion created by adjacent linear gradients.</p><p>The normal is being interpolated linearly across the surface. This also means that
                the lighting is changing somewhat linearly across the surface. While the lighting
                isn't a linear change, it can be approximated as one over a small area of the
                surface.</p><p>The edge between two triangles changes how the light interacts. On one side, the
                nearly-linear gradient has one slope, and on the other side, it has a different one.
                That is, the rate at which the gradients change abruptly changes.</p><p>Here is a simple demonstration of this:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e10207"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;10.9.&nbsp;Adjacent Gradient</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="GradientIssue.svg" alt="Adjacent Gradient"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>These are two adjacent linear gradients, from the bottom left corner to the top
                right. The color value increases in intensity as it goes from the bottom left to the
                top right. They meet along the diagonal in the middle. Both gradients have the same
                color value in the middle, yet it appears that there is a line down the center that
                is brighter than the colors on both sides. But it is not; the color on the right
                side of the diagonal is actually brighter than the diagonal itself.</p><p>That is the optical illusion. Here is a diagram that shows the color intensity as
                it moves across the above gradient:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e10217"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;10.10.&nbsp;Gradient Intensity Plot</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="GradientDiagram.svg" alt="Gradient Intensity Plot"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The color curve is continuous; there are no breaks or sudden jumps. But it is not
                a smooth curve; there is a sharp edge.</p><p>It turns out that human vision really wants to find sharp edges in smooth
                gradients. Anytime we see a sharp edge, our brains try to turn that into some kind
                of shape. And if there is a shape to the gradient intersection, such as a line, we
                tend to see that intersection <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">pop</span>&#8221;</span> out at us.</p><p>The solution to this problem is not yet available to us. One of the reasons we can
                see this so clearly is that the surface has a very regular diffuse reflectance (ie:
                color). If the surface color was irregular, if it changed at most every fragment,
                then the effect would be virtually impossible to notice.</p><p>But the real source of the problem is that the normal is being linearly
                interpolated. While this is certainly much better than interpolating the per-vertex
                lighting output, it does not produce a normal that matches with the normal of a
                perfect cylinder. The correct solution, which we will get to eventually, is to
                provide a way to encode the normal for a surface at many points, rather than simply
                interpolating vertex normals.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tut10 Interpolation.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Tutorial 10.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut10 Distant Points of Light.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Interpolation&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Distant Points of Light</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
