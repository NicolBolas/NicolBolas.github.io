                    resemblance to what the viewer sees. These typically generate an object
                    procedurally by cutting fragments out to form a shape, and then use normals to
                    do lighting computations on the cut-out.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Fragments can be discarded from within a fragment shader. This prevents the
                    outputs from the shader from being written to the final image.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Ray tracing can be employed by a fragment shader to determine the position and
                    normal for a point. Those values can be fed into the lighting equation to
                    produce a color value.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Fragment shaders can change the depth value that is used for the depth test
                    and is written to the framebuffer.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Geometry shaders are a shader stage between the vertex shader and the
                    rasterizer. They take a primitive as input and return one or more primitives as
                    output.</p></li></ul></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e13316"></a>Further Study</h3></div></div></div><p>Try doing these things with the given programs.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The first version of our impostors was a sphere approximation. It was not
                        useful for relatively large spheres, but it could be useful for small ones.
                        However, that approximation did not compute the depth of the fragment
                        correctly. Make a version of it that does.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Change the geometry impostor tutorial to take another vertex input: the
                        material to use. The vertex shader should pass it along to the geometry
                        shader, and the geometry shader should hand it to the fragment shader. You
                        can still use <code class="varname">gl_PrimitiveID</code> as the way to tell the
                        fragment shader. Regardless of how you send it, you will need to convert the
                        value to an integer at some point. That can be done with this
                        constructor-like syntax: <code class="literal">int(value_to_convert)</code>.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e13334"></a>Further Research</h3></div></div></div><p>This is an introduction to the concept of impostors. Indeed, the kind of ray
                tracing that we did has often been used to render more complex shapes like cylinders
                or quadratic surfaces. But impostors are capable of much, much more.</p><p>In effect, impostors allow you to use the fragment shader to just draw stuff to an
                area of the screen. They can be used to rasterize perfect circles, rather than
                drawing line-based approximations. Some have even used them to rasterize B&eacute;zier
                curves perfectly.</p><p>There are other impostor-based solutions. Most particle systems (a large and
                vibrant topic that you should investigate) use flat-cards to draw pictures that move
                through space. These images can animate, changing from one image to another based on
                time, and large groups of these particles can be used to simulate various phenomena
                like smoke, fire, and the like.</p><p>All of these subjects are worthy of your time. Of course, moving pictures through
                space requires being able to draw pictures. That means textures, which
                coincidentally is the topic for our next section.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e13345"></a>GLSL Features of Note</h3></div></div></div><div class="glosslist"><dl><dt>discard</dt><dd><p>This fragment shader-only directive will cause the outputs of the
