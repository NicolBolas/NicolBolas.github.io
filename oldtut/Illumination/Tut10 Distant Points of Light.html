Use the <span class="keycap"><strong>i</strong></span> key to
            raise the light up really high. Notice how bright all of the upwardly-facing surfaces
            get:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e10243"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;10.11.&nbsp;High Light</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="High%20Light.png" alt="High Light"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>You probably have no experience with this in real life. Holding a light farther from
            the surface in reality does not make the light brighter. So obviously something is
            happening in reality that our simple lighting model is not accounting for.</p><p>In reality, lights emit a certain quantity of light per unit time. For a point-like
            light such as a light bulb, it emits this light radially, in all directions. The farther
            from the light source one gets, the more area that this must ultimately cover.</p><p>Light is essentially a wave. The farther away from the source of the wave, the less
            intense the wave is. For light, this is called <em class="glossterm">light
            attenuation.</em></p><p>Our model does not include light attenuation, so let's fix that.</p><p>Attenuation is a well-understood physical phenomenon. In the absence of other factors
            (atmospheric light scattering, etc), the light intensity varies with the inverse of the
            square of the distance. An object 2 units away from the light feels the light with
            one-fourth the intensity. So our equation for light attenuation is as follows:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e10261"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;10.1.&nbsp;Physical Light Attenuation</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="LightAttenEq.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>There is a constant in the equation, which is used for unit correction. Of course, we
            can (and will) use it as a fudge factor to make things look right.</p><p>The constant can take on a physical meaning. The constant can mean the distance at
            which half of the light intensity is lost. To compute such a constant, for a half-light
            distance of r<sub>&#955;</sub>, use this equation:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="HalfLightAtten.svg"></div></div><p>This equation computes physically realistic light attenuation for point-lights. But it
            often does not look very good. The equation tends to create a sharper intensity falloff than
            one would expect.</p><p>There is a reason for this, but it is not one we are ready to get into quite yet. What
            is often done is to simply use the inverse rather than the inverse-square of the
            distance:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e10282"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;10.2.&nbsp;Light Attenuation Inverse</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="LightAttenInvEq.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>It looks brighter at greater distances than the physically correct model. This is fine
            for simple examples, but as we get more advanced, it will not be acceptable. This
            solution is really just a stop-gap; the real solution is one that we will discuss in a
            few tutorials.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e10290"></a>Reverse of the Transform</h3></div></div></div><p>However, there is a problem. We previously did per-fragment lighting in model
                space. And while this is a perfectly useful space to do lighting in, model space is
                not world space.</p><p>We want to specify the attenuation constant factor in terms of world space
                distances. But we are not dealing in world space; we are in model space. And model
                space distances are, naturally, in model space, which may well be scaled relative to
                world space. Here, any kind of scale in the model-to-world transform is a problem,
                not just non-uniform scales. Although if there was a uniform scale, we could apply
                theoretically apply the scale to the attenuation constant.</p><p>So now we cannot use model space. Fortunately, camera space is a space that has
                the same scale as world space, just with a rotation/translation applied to it. So we
                can do our lighting in that space.</p><p>Doing it in camera space requires computing a camera space position and passing it
                to the fragment shader to be interpolated. And while we could do this, that's not
                clever enough. Is not there some way to get around that?</p><p>Yes, there is. Recall <code class="varname">gl_FragCoord</code>, an intrinsic value given to
                every fragment shader. It represents the location of the fragment in window space.
                So instead of transforming from model space to camera space, we will transform from
                window space to camera space.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The use of this reverse-transformation technique here should not be taken as a
                    suggestion to use it in all, or even most cases like this. In all likelihood, it
                    will be much slower than just passing the camera space position to the fragment
                    shader. It is here primarily for demonstration purposes, and because it will be
                    useful in the future.</p></div><p>The sequence of transformations that take a position from camera space to window

                    <code class="varname">bUseRSquare</code> uses a new type: boolean.</p><p>GLSL has the <span class="type">bool</span> type just like C++ does. The
                    <code class="literal">true</code> and <code class="literal">false</code> values work just like C++'s
                equivalents. Where they differ is that GLSL also has vectors of bools, called
                    <span class="type">bvec#</span>, where the # can be 2, 3, or 4. We do not use that here, but
                it is important to note.</p><p>OpenGL's API, however, is still a C API. And C (at least, pre-C99) has no
                    <span class="type">bool</span> type. Uploading a boolean value to a shader looks like
                this:</p><pre class="programlisting">glUniform1i(g_FragWhiteDiffuseColor.bUseRSquareUnif, g_bUseRSquare ? <span class="code-number">1</span> : <span class="code-number">0</span>);</pre><p>The integer form of uniform uploading is used, but the floating-point form could
                be allowed as well. The number 0 represents false, and any other number is
                true.</p><p>The <code class="classname">UnProjection</code> uniform block contains data that only
                changes when the window changes. This uniform block is updated along with the vertex
                shader's <code class="classname">Projection</code> block. This data is used to perform the

                different functions makes sense. So we do that. The first function is one that

                functions.</p><p>The first three lines compute the position in normalized device coordinates.
                Notice that the computation of the X and Y coordinates is simplified from the
                original function. This is because our viewport always sets the lower-left position
                of the viewport to (0, 0). This is what you get when you plug zeros into that
                equation.</p><p>The <code class="varname">gl_DepthRange</code> variable is a special uniform defined by GLSL
                for fragment shaders. As the name suggests, it properly mirrors the values passed to
                    <code class="function">glDepthRange</code>; this way, we do not have to put it in our
                uniform block.</p><p>After the transformation to NDC space, we compute the clip-space position as
                previously shown. Then the result is multiplied through the clip-to-camera matrix,
                and that vector is returned to the caller.</p><p>This is a simple function that uses only uniforms to compute a value. It takes no
                arguments.

                definition syntax. Parameters to GLSL functions are designated as being inputs,
                outputs, or inputs and outputs.</p><p>Parameters designated with <code class="literal">in</code> are input parameters. Functions
                can change these values, but they will have no effect on the variable or expression
                used in the function call. This is much like the default in C/C++, where parameter
                changes are local. Naturally, this is the default with GLSL parameters if you do not
                specify a qualifier.</p><p>Parameters designated with <code class="literal">out</code> can be written to, and its value
                will be returned to the calling function. These are similar to non-const reference
                parameter types in C++. And just as with reference parameters, the caller of a
                function must call it with a real variable (called an <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">l-value</span>&#8221;</span>). And
                this variable must be a variable that can be <span class="emphasis"><em>changed</em></span>, so you
                cannot pass a uniform or shader stage input value as this parameter.</p><p>However, the initial value of parameters declared as outputs is
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> initialized from the calling function. This means that
                the initial value is uninitialized and therefore undefined (ie: it could be
                anything). Because of this, you can pass shader stage outputs as
                    <code class="literal">out</code> parameters. Recall that shader stage output variables can
                be written to, but <span class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span> read from.</p><p>Parameters designated as <code class="literal">inout</code> will have its value initialized
                by the caller and have the final value returned to the caller. These are exactly
                like non-const reference parameters in C++. The main difference is that the value is
                initialized with the one that the user passed in, which forbids the passing of
                shader stage outputs as <code class="literal">inout</code> parameters.</p><p>This particular function is semi-complex, as an optimization. Previously, our
                functions simply normalized the difference between the vertex position and the light
                position. In computing the attenuation, we need the distance between the two. And
                the process of normalization computes the distance. So instead of calling the GLSL
                function to normalize the direction, we do it ourselves, so that the distance is not
                computed twice (once in the GLSL function and once for us).</p><p>The second line performs a dot product with the same vector. Remember that the dot
                product between two vectors is the cosine of the angle between them, multiplied by
                each of the lengths of the vectors. Well, the angle between a vector and itself is
                zero, and the cosine of zero is always one. So what you get is just the length of
                the two vectors times one another. And since the vectors are the same, the lengths
                are the same. Thus, the dot product of a vector with itself is the square of its
                length.</p><p>To normalize a vector, we must divide the vector by it's length. And the length of
                    <code class="varname">lightDifference</code> is the square root of
                    <code class="varname">lightDistanceSqr</code>. The <code class="function">inversesqrt</code>
                computes 1 / the square root of the given value, so all we need to do is multiply
                this with the <code class="varname">lightDifference</code> to get the light direction as a
                normalized vector. This value is written to our output variable.</p><p>The next line computes our lighting term. Notice the use of the ?: operator. This
                works just like in C/C++. If we are using the square of the distance, that's what we
                store. Otherwise we get the square-root and store that.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The assumption in using ?: here is that only one or the other of the two
                    expressions will be evaluated. That's why the expensive call to
                        <code class="function">sqrt</code> is done here. However, this may not be the case.
                    It is entirely possible (and quite likely) that the shader will always evaluate
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>both</em></span> expressions and simply store one value or the
                    other as needed. So do not rely on such conditional logic to save
                    performance.</p></div><p>After that, things proceed as expected.</p><p>Making these separate functions makes the main function look almost identical to
                prior versions:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e10638"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;10.11.&nbsp;Main Light Attenuation</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-type">void</span> main()

                noted before. The camera-space position is determined. Then the light intensity,

                    useful to model light attenuation in a very different way. This is in no way
                    physically accurate, but it can look reasonably good.</p><p>We simply do linear interpolation based on the distance. When the distance is
                    0, the light has full intensity. When the distance is beyond a given distance,
                    the maximum light range (which varies per-light), the intensity is 0.</p><p>Note that <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">reasonably good</span>&#8221;</span> depends on your needs. The closer you
                    get in other ways to providing physically accurate lighting, the closer you get
                    to photorealism, the less you can rely on less accurate phenomena. It does no
                    good to implement a complicated sub-surface scattering lighting model that
                    includes Fresnel factors and so forth, while simultaneously using a simple
                    interpolation lighting attenuation model.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tut10 Fragment Lighting.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Tutorial 10.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut10 In Review.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Fragment Lighting&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;In Review</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
