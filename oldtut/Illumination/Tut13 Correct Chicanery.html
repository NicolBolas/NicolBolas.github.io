It has no polygonal outlines and you can zoom in
            on it forever. However, it is unfortunately very wrong.</p><p>To see how, toggle back to rendering the mesh on sphere <span class="keycap"><strong>1</strong></span> (the
            central blue one). Then move the camera so that the sphere is at the left edge of the
            screen. Then toggle back to impostor rendering.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e12797"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;13.3.&nbsp;Bad Impostor</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Impostor%20No%20Perspective.png" alt="Bad Impostor"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>What's going on here? The mesh sphere seems to be wider than the impostor sphere. This
            must mean that the mesh sphere is doing something our impostor is not. Does this have to
            do with the inaccuracy of the mesh sphere?</p><p>Quite the opposite, in fact. The mesh sphere is correct. The problem is that our
            impostor is too simple.</p><p>Look back at how we did our computations. We map a sphere down to a flat surface. The
            problem is that <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">down</span>&#8221;</span> in this case is in the camera-space Z direction. The
            mapping between the surface and the sphere is static; it does not change based on the
            viewing angle.</p><p>Consider this 2D case:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e12814"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;13.4.&nbsp;Circle Projection</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="CircleInPerspective.svg" alt="Circle Projection"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The dark line through the circle represents the square we drew. When viewing the
            sphere off to the side like this, we should not be able to see the left-edge of the
            sphere facing perpendicular to the camera. And we should see some of the sphere on the
            right that is behind the plane.</p><p>So how do we solve this?</p><p>Use better math. Our last algorithm is a decent approximation if the spheres are
            somewhat small. But if the spheres are reasonably large (which also can mean close to
            the camera), then our approximation is shown to be very fake. Our new algorithm needs to
            take this into account.</p><p>This algorithm is based on a term you may have heard before: <em class="glossterm">ray
                tracing.</em> We will not be implementing a full ray tracing algorithm here;
            instead, we will use it solely to get the position and normal of a sphere at a certain
            point.</p><p>A ray is a direction and a position; it represents a line extending from the position
            along that direction. The points on the ray can be expressed as the following
            equation:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e12833"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;13.1.&nbsp;Ray Equation</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="RayEquation.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>The <code class="varname">t</code> value can be positive or negative, but for our needs, we'll
            stick with positive values.</p><p>For each fragment, we want to create a ray from the camera position in the direction
            towards that point on the impostor square. Then we want to detect the point on the
            sphere that it hits, if any. If the ray intersects the sphere, then we use that point
            and normal for our lighting equation.</p><p>The math for this is fairly simple. The equation for the points on a sphere is
            this:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e12848"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;13.2.&nbsp;Sphere Equation</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="SphereEquation.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>For any point P, if this equation is true, if the length between that point and the
            sphere's center equals the radius, then P is on the sphere. So we can substitute our ray
            equation for P:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="RayTraceDeriv_1.svg"></div></div><p>Our ray goes from the camera into the scene. Since we're in camera space, the camera
            is at the origin. So O can be eliminated from the equation. To solve for
                <code class="varname">t</code>, we need to get rid of that length. One way to do it is to
            re-express the sphere equation as the length squared. So then we get:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="RayTraceDeriv_2.svg"></div></div><p>The square of the length of a vector is the same as that vector dot-producted with
            itself. So let's do that:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="RayTraceDeriv_3.svg"></div></div><p>The dot product is distributive. Indeed, it follows most of the rules of scalar
            multiplication. This gives us:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="RayTraceDeriv_4.svg"></div></div><p>While this equation has a lot of vector elements in it, as far as t is concerned, it
            is a scalar equation. Indeed, it is a quadratic equation, with respect to t. Ah, good
            old algebra.</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="RayTraceDeriv_5.svg"></div></div><p>In case you've forgotten, the part under the square root in the quadratic formula is
            called the discriminant. If this value is negative, then the equation has no solution.
            In terms of our ray test, this means the ray misses the sphere.</p><p>As you may recall, the square root can be either positive or negative. This gives us
            two t values. Which makes sense; the ray hits the sphere in two places: once going in,
            and once coming out. The correct t value that we're interested in is the smallest one.
            Once we have that, we can use the ray equation to compute the point. With the point and
            the center of the sphere, we can compute the normal. And we're back in business.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e12891"></a>Extorting and Expanding</h3></div></div></div><p>To see this done, open up the last tutorial project. Since they use the exact same
                source, and since they use the same uniforms and other interfaces for their shaders,
                there was no need to make another code project for it. To see the ray-traced
                version, press the <span class="keycap"><strong>J</strong></span> key; all impostors will use the perspective
