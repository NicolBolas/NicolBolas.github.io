            expensive than diffuse lighting. But which is ultimately more expensive than the
            others?</p><p>The difference between Phong and Blinn is that Phong must compute the reflection
            vector, while Blinn computes the half-angle vector. The equation for computing the
            reflection vector is:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="ReflectionVector.svg"></div></div><p>This involves a vector dot product, a scalar multiply, a vector-scalar multiply, and a
            vector addition (subtraction). Computing the half-angle vector requires doing a vector
            addition and performing a normalize operation. Normalizing a vector requires a vector
            dot product (dotting the vector with itself), taking the square-root of that value, and
            then a vector-scalar divide by that value.</p><p>Time once was that it was easy to know what was faster. The presence of a square-root
            operation alone would have condemned Blinn as the slower method. On modern 3D graphics
            hardware however, taking the reciprocal square-root (1 / &#8730;X) is generally about as fast
            as doing a vector multiply. This puts Blinn as approximately equal in performance to
            Phong; on some hardware, it may even be faster. In general, the performance difference
            between the two will be negligible.</p><p>Gaussian is a different story. It would be reasonable to expect the
                <code class="function">pow</code> function, taking <span class="mathphrase">x<sup>y</sup></span> for arbitrary values, to be slower than executing
                <code class="function">exp</code>, <span class="mathphrase">e<sup>x</sup></span>. They might have the same performance, but if one is going to be
            faster, it is more likely to be <code class="function">exp</code> than <code class="function">pow</code>.
            However, Gaussian also uses the inverse cosine to compute the angle between the normal
            and half-angle vector; that pretty much negates any possibility of performance parity.
            The inverse cosine computation is certainly not built into the hardware, and thus must
            be computed using the shader logic. And while this is likely true of exponentiation and
            power functions, Gaussian has to do <span class="emphasis"><em>two</em></span> of these operations,
            compared to just one for Phong or Blinn.</p><p>One might consider using Gouraud shading with specular reflections as a method of
            optimization. That is, doing per-vertex specular reflections. Since there are fewer
            vertices than fragments, this might sound like a good idea. However, this is not for the
            best. Specular highlights do not interpolate linearly at all, so unless the mesh is
            finely divided, it will generally look awful.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tut11 Gaussian.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Tutorial 11.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut11 In Review.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Gaussian&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;In Review</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
