        of skin, rock, or something else that you can look at in an image editor. While it is true
        that many textures are pictures of something, it would be wrong to limit your thoughts in
        terms of textures to just being pictures. Sadly, this way of thinking about textures is
        reinforced by OpenGL; data in textures are <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">colors</span>&#8221;</span> and many functions dealing
        with textures have the word <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">image</span>&#8221;</span> somewhere in them.</p><p>The best way to avoid this kind of thinking is to have our first textures be of those
        non-picture types of textures. So as our introduction to the world of textures, let us
        define a problem that textures can solve without having to be pictures.</p><p>We have seen that the Gaussian specular function is a pretty useful specular function. Its
        shininess value has a nice range (0, 1], and it produces pretty good results visually. It
        has fewer artifacts than the less complicated Blinn-Phong function. But there is one
        significant problem: Gaussian is much more expensive to compute. Blinn-Phong requires a
        single power-function; Gaussian requires not only exponentiation, but also an inverse-cosine
        function. This is in addition to other operations like squaring the exponent.</p><p>Let us say that we have determined that the Gaussian specular function is good but too
        expensive for our needs.<sup>[<a name="d0e13501" href="#ftn.d0e13501" class="footnote">7</a>]</sup> So we want to find a way to get the equivalent quality of Gaussian specular but
        with more performance. What are our options?</p><p>A common tactic in optimizing math functions is a <em class="glossterm">look-up table</em>.
        These are arrays of some dimensionality that represents a function. For any function <span class="mathphrase">F(x)</span>, where x is valid over some range [a, b], you can define a table that
        stores the results of the function at various points along the valid range of x. Obviously
        if x has an infinite range, there is a problem. But if x has a finite range, one can decide
        to take some number of values on that range and store them in a table.</p><p>The obvious downside of this approach is that the quality you get depends on how large this
        table is. That is, how many times the function is evaluated and stored in the table.</p><p>The Gaussian specular function takes three parameters: the surface normal, the half-angle
        vector, and the specular shininess of the surface. However, if we redefine the specular
        function in terms of the dot-product of the surface normal and the half-angle vector, we can
        reduce the number of parameters to two. Also, the specular shininess is a constant value
        across a mesh. So, for any given mesh, the specular function is a function of one parameter:
        the dot-product between the half-angle vector and the surface normal.</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e13518"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;14.1.&nbsp;Gaussian as Function of One Variable</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="GaussianLookup.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>So how do we get a look-up table to the shader? We could use the obvious method; build a
        uniform buffer containing an array of floats. We would multiply the dot-product by the
        number of entries in the table and pick a table entry based on that value. By now, you
        should be able to code this.</p><p>But lets say that we want another alternative; what else can we do? We can put our look-up
        table in a texture.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e13528"></a>The First Texture</h2></div></div></div><p>A <em class="glossterm">texture</em> is an object that contains one or more arrays of
            data, with all of the arrays having some dimensionality. The storage for a texture is
            owned by OpenGL and the GPU, much like they own the storage for buffer objects. Textures
            can be accessed in a shader, which fetches data from the texture at a specific location
            within the texture's arrays.</p><p>The arrays within a texture are called <em class="glossterm">images</em>; this is a legacy
            term, but it is what they are called. Textures have a <em class="glossterm">texture
                type</em>; this defines characteristics of the texture as a whole, like the
            number of dimensions of the images and a few other special things.</p><p>Our first use of textures is in the <span class="propername">Basic Texture</span>

                represents our lookup table. It's a pretty simple function. The parameter
                    <code class="varname">cosAngleResolution</code> specifies the number of entries in the
                table. As we iterate over the range, we convert them into cosine values and then
                perform the Gaussian specular computations.</p><p>However, the result of this computation is a <span class="type">float</span>, not a
                    <span class="type">GLubyte</span>. Yet our array contains bytes. It is here that we must
                introduce a new concept widely used with textures: <em class="glossterm">normalized
                    integers</em>.</p><p>A normalized integer is a way of storing floating-point values on the range [0, 1]
                in far fewer than the 32-bytes it takes for a regular <span class="type">float</span>. The idea
                is to take the full range of the integer and map it to the [0, 1] range. The full
                range of an unsigned integer is [0, 255]. So to map it to a floating-point range of
                [0, 1], we simply divide the value by 255.</p><p>The above code takes the <code class="varname">gaussianTerm</code> and converts it into a
                normalized integer.</p><p>This saves a lot of memory. By using normalized integers in our texture, we save
                4x the memory over a floating-point texture. When it comes to textures, oftentimes
                saving memory improves performance. And since this is supposed to be a performance
                optimization over shader computations, it makes sense to use a normalized integer
                value.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e13611"></a>Texture Objects</h3></div></div></div><p>The function <code class="function">CreateGaussianTexture</code> calls

                similar to other <code class="function">glGen*</code> functions we have seen.
                    <code class="function">glBindTexture</code> attaches the texture object to the context.
                The first parameter specifies the texture's type. Note that once you have bound a
                texture to the context with a certain type, it must <span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> be
                bound with that same type. <code class="literal">GL_TEXTURE_1D</code> means that the texture
                contains one-dimensional images.</p><p>The next function, <code class="function">glTexImage1D</code> is how we allocate storage
                for the texture and pass data to the texture. It is similar to
                    <code class="function">glBufferData</code>, though it has many more parameters. The first
                specifies the type of the currently bound texture. As with buffer objects, multiple
                textures can be bound to different texture type locations. So you could have a
                texture bound to <code class="literal">GL_TEXTURE_1D</code> and another boudn to
                    <code class="literal">GL_TEXTURE_2D</code>. But it's really bad form to try to exploit
                this. It is best to just have one target bound at a time.</p><p>The second parameter is something we will talk about in the next tutorial. The
                third parameter is the format that OpenGL will use to store the texture's data. The
                fourth parameter is the width of the image, which corresponds to the length of our
                lookup table. The fifth parameter must always be 0; it represents an old feature no
                longer supported.</p><p>The last three parameters of all functions of the form
                    <code class="function">glTexImage*</code> are special. They tell OpenGL how to read the
                texture data in our array. This seems redundant, since we already told OpenGL what
                the format of the data was with the third parameter. This bears further
                examination.</p><p>Textures and buffer objects have many similarities. They both represent memory
                owned by OpenGL. The user can modify this memory with various functions. Besides the
                fact that a texture object can contain multiple images, the major difference is the
                arrangement of data as it is stored by the GPU.</p><p>Buffer objects are linear arrays of memory. The data stored by OpenGL must be
                binary-identical to the data that the user specifies with
                    <code class="function">glBuffer(Sub)Data</code> calls. The format of the data stored in a
                buffer object is defined externally to the buffer object itself. Buffer objects used
                for vertex attributes have their formats defined by
                    <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code>. The format for buffer objects that
                store uniform data is defined by the arrangement of types in a GLSL uniform
                block.</p><p>There are other ways that use buffer objects that allow OpenGL calls to fill them
                with data. But in all cases, the binary format of the data to be stored is very
                strictly controlled by the user. It is the <span class="emphasis"><em>user's</em></span>
                responsibility to make sure that the data stored there uses the format that OpenGL
                was told to expect. Even when OpenGL itself is generating the data being stored in
                it.</p><p>Textures do not work this way. The format of an image stored in a texture is
                controlled by OpenGL itself. The user tells it what format to use, but the specific
                arrangements of bytes is up to OpenGL. This allows different hardware to store
                textures in whatever way is most optimal for accessing them.</p><p>Because of this, there is an intermediary between the data the user provides and
                the data that is actually stored in the texture. The data the user provides must be
                transformed into the format that OpenGL uses internally for the texture's data.
                Therefore, <code class="function">glTexImage*</code> functions must specify both the expected
                internal format and a description of how the texture data is stored in the user's
                array.</p><p><b>Pixel Transfer and Formats.&nbsp;</b>This process, the conversion between an image's internal format and a
                    user-provided array, is called a <em class="glossterm">pixel transfer</em>
                    operation. These are somewhat complex, but not too difficult to
                    understand.</p><p>Each pixel in a texture is more properly referred to as a
                    <em class="glossterm">texel</em>. Since texture data is accessed in OpenGL by the
                texel, we want our array of normalized unsigned integers to each be stored in a
                single texel. So our input data has only one value per texel, that value is 8-bits
                in size, and it represents an normalized unisgned integer.</p><p>The last three parameters describe this to OpenGL. The parameter
                    <code class="literal">GL_RED</code> says that we are uploading a single component to the
                texture, namely the red component. Components of texels are named after color
                components. Because this parameter does not end in <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">_INTEGER</span>&#8221;</span>, OpenGL
                knows that the data we are uploading is either a floating-point value or a
                normalized integer value (which converts to a float when accessed by the
                shader).</p><p>The parameter <code class="literal">GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE</code> says that each component that we
                are uploading is stored in an 8-bit unsigned byte. This, plus the pointer to the
                data, is all OpenGL needs to read our data.</p><p>That describes the data format as we are providing it. The format parameter, the
                third parameter to the <code class="function">glTexImage*</code> functions, describes the
                format of the texture's internal storage. The texture's format defines the
                properties of the texels stored in that texture:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The components stored in the texel. Multiple components can be used, but
                        only certain combinations of components are allowed. The components include
                        the RGBA of colors, and certain more exotic values we will discuss
                        later.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The number of bits that each component takes up when stored by OpenGL.

                        components different types, but most of them give them each the same data
                        type. Data types include normalized unsigned integers, floats,
                        non-normalized signed integers, and so forth.</p></li></ul></div><p>The parameter <code class="literal">GL_R8</code> defines all of these. The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">R</span>&#8221;</span>
                represents the components that are stored. Namely, the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">red</span>&#8221;</span> component.
                Since textures used to always represent image data, the components are named after
                components of a color vec4. Each component takes up <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">8</span>&#8221;</span> bits. The
                suffix of the format represents the data type. Since unsigned normalized values are
                so common, they get the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">no suffix</span>&#8221;</span> suffix; all other data types have a
                specific suffix. Float formats use <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">f</span>&#8221;</span>; a red, 32-bit float internal
                format would use <code class="literal">GL_R32F</code>.</p><p>Note that this perfectly matches the texture data that we generated. We tell
                OpenGL to make the texture store unsigned normalized 8-bit integers, and we provide
                unsigned normalized 8-bit integers as the input data.</p><p>This is not strictly necessary. We could have used <code class="literal">GL_R16</code> as
                our format instead. OpenGL would have created a texture that contained 16-bit
                unsigned normalized integers. OpenGL would then have had to convert our input data
                to the 16-bit format. It is good practice to try to match the texture's format with
                the format of the data that you upload to OpenGL.</p><p>The calls to <code class="function">glTexParameter</code> set parameters on the texture
                object. These parameters define certain properties of the texture. Exactly what
                these parameters are doing is something that will be discussed in the next
                tutorial.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e13763"></a>Textures in Shaders</h3></div></div></div><p>OK, so we have a texture object, which has a texture type. We need some way to
                represent that texture in GLSL. This is done with something called a <em class="glossterm">GLSL
                    sampler</em>. Samplers are special types in OpenGL; they represent a
                texture that has been bound to the OpenGL context. For every OpenGL texture type,
                there is a corresponding sampler type. So a texture that is of type

                think of it like a normal basic type. Think of it instead as a specific hook into
                the shader that the user can use to supply a texture. The restrictions on variables
                of sampler types are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Samplers can only declared at the global scope as

                creating a sampler:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-modifier">uniform</span> <span class="code-sampler">sampler1D</span> gaussianTexture;</pre><p>This creates a sampler for a 1D texture type; the user cannot use any other type
                of texture with this sampler.</p><p><b>Texture Sampling.&nbsp;</b>The process of fetching data from a texture, at a particular location, is
                    called <em class="glossterm">sampling.</em> This is done in the shader as part of
                    the lighting computation:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e13818"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;14.3.&nbsp;Shader Texture Access</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-type">vec3</span> halfAngle = <span class="code-function">normalize</span>(lightDir + viewDirection);
<span class="code-type">float</span> texCoord = <span class="code-function">dot</span>(halfAngle, surfaceNormal);
<span class="code-type">float</span> gaussianTerm = <span class="code-function">texture</span>(gaussianTexture, texCoord).r;

gaussianTerm = cosAngIncidence != <span class="code-number">0.0</span> ? gaussianTerm : <span class="code-number">0.0</span>;</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>The third line is where the texture is accessed. The function
                    <code class="function">texture</code> accesses the texture denoted by the first parameter
                (the sampler to fetch from). It accesses the value of the texture from the location
                specified by the second parameter. This second parameter, the location to fetch
                from, is called the <em class="glossterm">texture coordinate</em>. Since our texture has
                only one dimension, our texture coordinate also has one dimension.</p><p>The <code class="function">texture</code> function for 1D textures expects the texture
                coordinate to be normalized. This means something similar to normalizing integer
                values. A normalized texture coordinate is a texture coordinate where the coordinate
                values range from [0, 1] refer to texel coordinates (the coordinates of the pixels
                within the textures) to [0, texture-size].</p><p>What this means is that our texture coordinates do not have to care how big the
                texture is. We can change the texture's size without changing anything about how we
                compute the texture coordinate. A coordinate of 0.5 will always mean the middle of
                the texture, regardless of the size of that texture.</p><p>A texture coordinate values outside of the [0, 1] range must still map to a
                location on the texture. What happens to such coordinates depends on values set in
                OpenGL that we will see later.</p><p>The return value of the <code class="function">texture</code> function is a vec4,
                regardless of the image format of the texture. So even though our texture's format
                is <code class="literal">GL_R8</code>, meaning that it holds only one channel of data, we
                still get four in the shader. The other three components are 0, 0, and 1,
                respectively.</p><p>We get floating-point data back because our sampler is a floating-point sampler.
                Samplers use the same prefixes as <span class="type">vec</span> types. A <span class="type">ivec4</span>
                represents a vector of 4 integers, while a <span class="type">vec4</span> represents a vector of
                4 floats. Thus, an <span class="type">isampler1D</span> represents a texture that returns
                integers, while a <span class="type">sampler1D</span> is a texture that returns floats. Recall
                that 8-bit normalized unsigned integers are just a cheap way to store floats, so
                this matches everything correctly.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e13865"></a>Texture Binding</h3></div></div></div><p>We have a texture object, an OpenGL object that holds our image data with a
                specific format. We have a shader that contains a sampler uniform that represents a
                texture being accessed by our shader. How do we associate a texture object with a
                sampler in the shader?</p><p>Although the API is slightly more obfuscated due to legacy issues, this
                association is made essentially the same way as with uniform buffer objects.</p><p>The OpenGL context has an array of slots called <em class="glossterm">texture image
                    units</em>, also known as <em class="glossterm">image units</em> or
                    <em class="glossterm">texture units</em>. Each image unit represents a single
                texture. A sampler uniform in a shader is set to a particular image unit; this sets
                the association between the shader and the image unit. To associate an image unit
                with a texture object, we bind the texture to that unit.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e13883"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;14.2.&nbsp;Texture Binding and Context</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="TextureBindingDiagram.svg" alt="Texture Binding and Context"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Though the idea is essentially the same, there are many API differences between
                the UBO mechanism and the texture mechanism. We will start with setting the sampler
                uniform to an image unit.</p><p>With UBOs, this used a different API from regular uniforms. Because samplers are
                actual uniforms, the sampler API is just the uniform API:</p><pre class="programlisting">GLuint gaussianTextureUnif = glGetUniformLocation(data.theProgram, <span class="code-string">"gaussianTexture"</span>);
glUseProgram(data.theProgram);
glUniform1i(gaussianTextureUnif, g_gaussTexUnit);</pre><p>Sampler uniforms are considered 1-dimesional (scalar) integer values from the
                OpenGL side of the API. Do not forget that, in the GLSL side, samplers have no value
                at all.</p><p>When it comes time to bind the texture object to that image unit, OpenGL again
                overloads existing API rather than making a new one the way UBOs did:</p><pre class="programlisting">glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0 + g_gaussTexUnit);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_1D, g_gaussTextures[g_currTexture]);</pre><p>The <code class="function">glActiveTexture</code> function changes the current texture
                unit. All subsequent texture operations, whether <code class="function">glBindTexture</code>,
                    <code class="function">glTexImage</code>, <code class="function">glTexParameter</code>, etc,
                affect the texture bound to the current texture unit. To put it another way, with
                UBOs, it was possible to bind a buffer object to
                    <code class="literal">GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER</code> without overwriting any of the uniform
                buffer binding points. This is possible because there are two functions for buffer
                object binding: <code class="function">glBindBuffer</code> which binds only to the target,
                and <code class="function">glBindBufferRange</code> which binds to the target and an indexed
                location.</p><p>Texture units do not have this. There is one binding function,
                    <code class="function">glBindTexture</code>. And it always binds to whatever texture unit
                happens to be current. Namely, the one set by the last call to
                    <code class="function">glActiveTexture</code>.</p><p>What this means is that if you want to modify a texture, you must overwrite a
                texture unit that may already be bound. This is usually not a huge problem, because
                you rarely modify textures in the same area of code used to render. But you should
                be aware of this API oddity.</p><p>Also note the peculiar <code class="function">glActiveTexture</code> syntax for specifying
                the image unit: <code class="code">GL_TEXTURE0 + g_gaussTexUnit</code>. This is the correct way
                to specify which texture unit, because <code class="function">glActiveTexture</code> is
                defined in terms of an enumerator rather than integer texture image units.</p><p>If you look at the rendering function, you will find that the texture will always
                be bound, even when not rendering with the texture. This is perfectly harmless; the
                contents of a texture image unit is ignored unless a program has a sampler uniform
                that is associated with that image unit.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e13947"></a>Sampler Objects</h3></div></div></div><p>With the association between a texture and a program's sampler uniform made, there
                is still one thing we need before we render. There are a number of parameters the
                user can set that affects how texture data is fetched from the texture.</p><p>In our case, we want to make sure that the shader cannot access texels outside of
                the range of the texture. If the shader tries, we want the shader to get the nearest
                texel to our value. So if the shader passes a texture coordinate of -0.3, we want
                them to get the same texel as if they passed 0.0. In short, we want to clamp the
                texture coordinate to the range of the texture.</p><p>These kinds of settings are controlled by an OpenGL object called a
                    <em class="glossterm">sampler object.</em> The code that creates a sampler object
                for our textures is in the <code class="function">CreateGaussianTextures</code>
                function.</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e13962"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;14.4.&nbsp;Sampler Object Creation</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">glGenSamplers(<span class="code-number">1</span>, &amp;g_gaussSampler);

                    <code class="function">glGenSamplers</code>. However, notice something unusual with the
                next series of functions. We do not bind a sampler to the context to set parameters
                in it, nor does <code class="function">glSamplerParameter</code> take a context target. We
                simply pass an object directly to the function.</p><p>In this above code, we set three parameters. The first two parameters are things
                we will discuss in the next tutorial. The third parameter,
                    <code class="literal">GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S</code>, is how we tell OpenGL that texture
                coordinates should be clamped to the range of the texture.</p><p>OpenGL names the components of the texture coordinate <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">strq</span>&#8221;</span> rather
                than <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">xyzw</span>&#8221;</span> or <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">uvw</span>&#8221;</span> as is common. Indeed, OpenGL has two
                different names for the components: <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">strq</span>&#8221;</span> is used in the main API, but
                    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">stpq</span>&#8221;</span> is used in GLSL shaders. Much like <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">rgba</span>&#8221;</span>, you
                can use <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">stpq</span>&#8221;</span> as swizzle selectors for any vector instead of the
                traditional <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">xyzw</span>&#8221;</span>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The reason for the odd naming is that OpenGL tries to keep vector suffixes
                    from conflicting. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">uvw</span>&#8221;</span> does not work because <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">w</span>&#8221;</span> is
                    already part of the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">xyzw</span>&#8221;</span> suffix. In GLSL, the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">r</span>&#8221;</span> in
                        <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">strq</span>&#8221;</span> conflicts with <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">rgba</span>&#8221;</span>, so they had to go
                    with <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">stpq</span>&#8221;</span> instead.</p></div><p>The <code class="literal">GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S</code> parameter defines how the
                    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">s</span>&#8221;</span> component of the texture coordinate will be adjusted if it
                falls outside of the [0, 1] range. Setting this to
                    <code class="literal">GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE</code> clamps this component of the texture
                coordinate to the edge of the texture. Each component of the texture coordinate can
                have a separate wrapping mode. Since our texture is a 1D texture, its texture
                coordinates only have one component.</p><p>The sampler object is used similarly to how textures are associated with GLSL
                samplers: we bind them to a texture image unit. The API is much simpler than what we
                saw for textures:</p><pre class="programlisting">glBindSampler(g_gaussTexUnit, g_gaussSampler);</pre><p>We pass the texture unit directly; there is no need to add
                    <code class="literal">GL_TEXTURE0</code> to it to convert it into an enumerator. This
                effectively adds an additional value to each texture unit.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e14050"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;14.3.&nbsp;Sampler Binding and Context</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="SamplerBindingDiagram.svg" alt="Sampler Binding and Context"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Technically, we do not have to use a sampler object.

                    advantages over setting the value in the texture, and binding a sampler object
                    overrides parameters set in the texture. There are still some parameters that
                    must be in the texture object, and those are not overridden by the sampler
