            surface. Previously, the finest granularity that we could get for material parameters is
            per-vertex values. Textures allow us to get a granularity down to the texel. While we
            could target the most common material parameter controlled by textures (aka: the diffuse
            color), we will instead look at something less common. We will vary the specular
            shininess factor.</p><p>To achieve this variation of specular shininess, we must first find a way to associate
            points on our triangles with texels on a texture. This association is called
                <em class="glossterm">texture mapping</em>, since it maps between points on a triangle
            and locations on the texture. This is achieved by using texture coordinates that
            correspond with positions on the surface.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Some people refer to textures themselves as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">texture maps.</span>&#8221;</span> This is
                sadly widespread terminology, but is incorrect. This text will not refer to them as
                such, and you are strongly advised not to do the same.</p></div><p>In the last example, the texture coordinate was a value computed based on lighting
            parameters. The texture coordinate for accessing our shininess texture will instead come
            from interpolated per-vertex parameters. Hence the prior discussion of the specifics of
            interpolation.</p><p>For simple cases, we could generate the texture coordinate from vertex positions. And
            in some later tutorials, we will. In the vast majority of cases however, texture
            coordinates for texture mapping will be part of the per-vertex attribute data.</p><p>Since the texture map's coordinates come from per-vertex attributes, this will affect
            our mesh topography. It adds yet another channel with its own topology, which must be
            massaged into the overall topology of the mesh.</p><p>To see texture mapping in action, load up the <span class="propername">Material
                Texture</span> tutorial. This tutorial uses the same scene as before, but the
            infinity symbol can use a texture to define the specular shininess of the object.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e14219"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;14.6.&nbsp;Material Texture</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Material%20Texture.png" alt="Material Texture"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The <span class="keycap"><strong>Spacebar</strong></span> switches between one of three rendering modes: fixed

                <span class="keycap"><strong>Y</strong></span> key switches between the infinity symbol and a flat plane; this
            helps make it more obvious what the shininess looks like. The <span class="keycap"><strong>9</strong></span> key
            switches to a material with a dark diffuse color and bright specular color; this makes

                resolutions of Gaussian textures. Speaking of which, that works rather differently
                now.</p><p>Previously, we assumed that the specular shininess was a fixed value for the
                entire surface. Now that our shininess values can come from a texture, this is not
                the case. With the fixed shininess, we had a function that took one parameter: the
                dot-product of the half-angle vector with the normal. But with a variable shininess,
                we have a function of two parameters. Functions of two variables are often called
                    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">two dimensional.</span>&#8221;</span></p><p>It is therefore not surprising that we model such a function with a
                two-dimensional texture. The S texture coordinate represents the dot-product, while
                the T texture coordinate is the shininess value. Both range from [0, 1], so they fit
                within the expected range of texture coordinates.</p><p>Our new function for building the data for the Gaussian term is as follows:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e14258"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;14.5.&nbsp;BuildGaussianData in 2D</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-keyword">void</span> BuildGaussianData(std::vector&lt;GLubyte&gt; &amp;textureData,

The
                mapping of the plane is fairly obvious, but the infinity symbol's map is more
                interesting. Topologically, the infinity symbol is no different from that of a
                torus.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e14371"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;14.7.&nbsp;A Torus</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Torus.png" alt="A Torus"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>That is, the infinity symbol and a torus have the same connectivity between
                vertices; those vertices are just in different positions.</p><p>Mapping an object onto a 2D plane generally means finding a way to slice the
                object into pieces that fit onto that plane. However, a torus is, topologically
                speaking, equivalent to a plane. This plane is rolled into a tube, and bent around,
                so that each side connects to its opposing side directly. Therefore, mapping a
                texture onto this means reversing the process. The tube is cut at one end, creating
                a cylinder. Then, it is cut lengthwise, much like a car tire, and flattened out into
                a plane.</p><p>Exactly where those cuts need to be made is arbitrary. And because the specular
                texture mirrors perfectly in the S and T directions, it is not possible to tell
                exactly where the seams in the topology are. But they do need to be there.</p><p>What this does mean is that the vertices along the same have duplicate positions
                and normals. Because they have different texture coordinates, their shared positions
                and normals must be duplicated to match what OpenGL needs.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e14385"></a>Smudges on Glass</h3></div></div></div><p>The best way to understand how the shininess texture affects the rendered result
                is to switch to the dark material with the <span class="keycap"><strong>9</strong></span> key. The plane also
                shows this a bit easier than the curved infinity symbol.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e14393"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;14.8.&nbsp;Surface smudges</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Material%20Flat%20Rings.png" alt="Surface smudges"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The areas with lower shininess, the bright areas, look like smudge marks. While
                the bright marks in the highly shiny areas only reflect light when the light source
                is very close to perfectly reflecting, the lower shininess areas will reflect light
                from much larger angles.</p><p>One interesting thing to note is how our look-up table works with the flat
                surface. Even at the highest resolution, 512 individual values, the lookup table is
                pretty poor; a lot of concentric rings are plainly visible. It looked more
                reasonable on the infinity symbol because it was heavily curved, and therefore the
                specular highlights were much smaller. On this flat surface, the visual artifacts
                become much more obvious. The <span class="keycap"><strong>Spacebar</strong></span> can be used to switch to a
                shader-based computation to see the correct version.</p><p>If our intent was to show a smudged piece of metal or highly reflective black
                surface, we could enhance the effect by also applying a texture that changed the
                specular reflectance. Smudged areas don't tend to reflect as strongly as the shiny
                ones. We could use the same texture mapping (ie: the same texture coordinates) and
                the specular texture would not even have to be the same size as our shininess
                texture.</p><p>There is one more thing to note about the shininess texture. The size of the
                texture is 1024x256 in size. The reason for that is that the texture is intended to
                be used on the infinity symbol. This object is longer in model space than it is
                around. By making the texture map 4x longer in the axis that is mapped to the S
                coordinate, we are able to more closely maintain the aspect ratio of the objects on
                the texture than the flat plane we see here. All of those oval smudge marks you see
                are in fact round in the texture. They are still somewhat ovoid and distorted on the
                infinity symbol though.</p><p>It is generally the job of the artist creating the texture mapping to ensure that
                the aspect ratio and stretching of the mapped object remains reasonable for the
                texture. In the best possible case, every texel in the texture maps to the same
                physical size on the object's surface. Fortunately for a graphics programmer, doing
                that isn't your job.</p><p>Unless of course your job is writing the tool that the artists use to help them in
                this process.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tut14 Interpolation Redux.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Tutorial 14.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut14 In Review.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Interpolation Redux&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;In Review</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
