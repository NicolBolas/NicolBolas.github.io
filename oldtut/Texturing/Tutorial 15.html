Now, we will look at
        textures that are pictures. However, unlike the last tutorial, where the textures
        represented some parameter in the light equation, here, we will just be directly outputting
        the values read from the texture.</p><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Graphics Fudging</b></p><p>Before we begin however, there is something you may need to do. When you installed
            your graphics drivers, installed along with it was an application that allows you to
            provide settings for your graphics driver. This affects how graphics applications render
            and so forth.</p><p>Thus far, most of those settings have been irrelevant to us because everything we have
            done has been entirely in our control. The OpenGL specification defined almost exactly
            what could and could not happen, and outside of actual driver bugs, the results we
            produced are reproducible and nearly identical across hardware.</p><p>That is no longer the case, as of this tutorial.</p><p>Texturing has long been a place where graphics drivers have been given room to play
            and fudge results. The OpenGL specification plays fast-and-loose with certain aspects of
            texturing. And with the driving need for graphics card makers to have high performance
            and high image quality, graphics driver writers can, at the behest of the user, simply
            ignore the OpenGL spec with regard to certain aspects of texturing.</p><p>The image quality settings in your graphics driver provide control over this. They are
            ways for you to tell graphics drivers to ignore whatever the application thinks it
            should do and instead do things their way. That is fine for a game, but right now, we
            are learning how things work. If the driver starts pretending that we set some parameter
            that we clearly did not, it will taint our results and make it difficult to know what
            parameters cause what effects.</p><p>Therefore, you will need to go into your graphics driver application and change all of
            those setting to the value that means to do what the application says. Otherwise, the
            visual results you get for the following code may be very different from the given
            images. This includes settings for antialiasing.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e14660"></a>Playing Checkers</h2></div></div></div><p>We will start by drawing a single large, flat plane. The plane will have a texture of
            a checkerboard drawn on it. The camera will hover above the plane, looking out at the
            horizon as if the plane were the ground. This is implemented in the <span class="propername">Many Images</span> tutorial project.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e14669"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;15.1.&nbsp;Basic Checkerboard Plane</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="BasicCheckerboardPlane.png" alt="Basic Checkerboard Plane"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The camera is automatically controlled, though it's motion can be paused with the
                <span class="keycap"><strong>P</strong></span> key. The other functions of the tutorial will be explained as we
            get to them.</p><p>If you look at the <code class="filename">BigPlane.xml</code> file, you will find that the
            texture coordinates are well outside of the [0, 1] range we are used to. They span from
            [-64, 64] now, but the texture itself is only valid within the [0, 1] range.</p><p>Recall from the last tutorial that the sampler object has a parameter that controls
            what texture coordinates outside of the [0, 1] range mean. This tutorial uses many
            samplers, but all of our samplers use the same S and T wrap modes:</p><pre class="programlisting">glSamplerParameteri(g_samplers[samplerIx], GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_REPEAT);
glSamplerParameteri(g_samplers[samplerIx], GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_REPEAT);</pre><p>We set the S and T wrap modes to <code class="literal">GL_REPEAT</code>. This means that values
            outside of the [0, 1] range wrap around to values within the range. So a texture
            coordinate of 1.1 becomes 0.1, and a texture coordinate of -0.1 becomes 0.9. The idea is
            to make it as though the texture were infinitely large, with infinitely many copies
            repeating over and over.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>It is perfectly legitimate to set the texture coordinate wrapping modes
                differently for different coordinates. Well, usually; this does not work for certain
                texture types, but only because they take texture coordinates with special meanings.
                For them, the wrap modes are ignored entirely.</p></div><p>You may toggle between two meshes with the <span class="keycap"><strong>Y</strong></span> key. The alternative
            mesh is a long, square corridor.</p><p>The shaders used here are very simple. The vertex shader takes positions and texture
            coordinates as inputs and outputs the texture coordinate directly. The fragment shader
            takes the texture coordinate, fetches a texture with it, and writes that color value as
            output. Not even gamma correction is used.</p><p>The texture in question is 128x128 in size, with 4 alternating black and white squares
            on each side. Each of the black or white squares is 32 pixels across.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tut14 Glossary.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Texturing.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut15 Magnification.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Glossary&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Linear Filtering</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
