The
                        function is sampled at discrete intervals. To access the function, the input
                        values for the function are transformed into a discrete location in the
                        table and that value is returned.</p></dd><dt>texture</dt><dd><p>An object that contains one or more images of a particular dimensionality.
                        The data in the images can be fetched by the user in a shader. Textures have
                        a type, which represents the nature of that particular texture.</p></dd><dt>image</dt><dd><p>An array of data of a particular dimensionality. Images can be 1D, 2D, or
                        3D in size. The points of data in an image are 4-vector values, which can be
                        floating point or integers.</p></dd><dt>texture type</dt><dd><p>Represents the basic nature of the texture. The texture type defines the
                        dimensionality of the images it stores. It defines the size of the texture
                        coordinate that the texture takes, the number of images it can contain, and
                        various other information about the texture.</p></dd><dt>normalized integers</dt><dd><p>An integer that represents a floating-point value on the range [0, 1] for
                        unsigned integers and [-1, 1] for signed integers. Normalized integers use
                        their entire bitrange to represent a floating point value. The maximum value
                        for the integer's bitdepth represents the maximum floating point value, and
                        the minimum value for the integer's bitdepth represents the minimum floating
                        point value.</p></dd><dt>pixel transfer</dt><dd><p>The act of sending pixel data to an image in OpenGL, or receiving pixel
                        data from OpenGL.</p></dd><dt>texel</dt><dd><p>A pixel within a texture image. Used to distinguish between a pixel in a
                        destination image and pixels in texture images.</p></dd><dt>GLSL sampler</dt><dd><p>A number of types in GLSL that represents a texture bound to a texture
                        image unit of the OpenGL context. For every texture type in OpenGL, there is
                        a matching sampler type. There are a number of restrictions on the use of
                        samplers in GLSL. They can only be declared globally as uniforms and as
                        input parameters to functions. They can only be used as the value passed to
                        a function, whether user-defined or built-in.</p></dd><dt>sampling</dt><dd><p>The process of accessing data from one or more of the images of the
                        texture, using a specific texture coordinate.</p></dd><dt>texture coordinate</dt><dd><p>A value that is used to access locations within a texture. Each texture
                        type defines what dimensionality of texture coordinate it takes (note that
                        the texture type may define a different texture coordinate dimensionality
                        from the image dimensionality). Texture coordinates are often normalized on
                        the range [0, 1]. This allows texture coordinates to ignore the size of the
                        specific texture they are used with.</p><p>Texture coordinates are comprised by the S, T, R, and Q components, much
                        like regular vectors are composed of X, Y, Z, and W components. In GLSL, the
                        R component is called <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">P</span>&#8221;</span> instead.</p></dd><dt>texture image unit</dt><dd><p>An array of locations in the OpenGL context where texture objects are
                        bound to. Programs can have their GLSL sampler uniforms associated with one
                        of the entries in this array. When using such a program, it will use the
                        texture object bound to that location to find the texture for that GLSL
                        sampler.</p></dd><dt>sampler object</dt><dd><p>An OpenGL object that defines how a texture is accessed in the shader. The
                        parameters that are set on a sampler object can also be set on a texture
                        object, but if a sampler is bound to the same image unit as a texture, then
                        the sampler takes precidence.</p></dd><dt>perspective-correct interpolation</dt><dd><p>A scheme for interpolating values across the surface of a triangle in
                        pre-projection space. This is necessary when working with perspective
                        projections. This is the default interpolation scheme in OpenGL; it can be
                        selectively disabled with the <code class="literal">noperspective</code> GLSL
                        qualifier.</p></dd><dt>texture mapping</dt><dd><p>The association between one or more textures and positions on the surface.
                        This association is made by putting texture coordinates in the per-vertex
                        attribute data. Therefore, each triangle vertex has a texture
                        coordinate.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tut14 In Review.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Tutorial 14.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tutorial 15.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">In Review&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Chapter&nbsp;15.&nbsp;Many Images</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
