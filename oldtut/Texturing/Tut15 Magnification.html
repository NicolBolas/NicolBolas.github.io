            visual issues. We will start finding solutions to this with the least obvious glitches
            first.</p><p>Take a look at one of the squares at the very bottom of the screen. Notice how the
            line looks jagged as it moves to the left and right. You can see the pixels of it sort
            of crawl up and down as it shifts around on the plane.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e14714"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;15.2.&nbsp;Jagged Texture Edge</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="NearestZoom.png" alt="Jagged Texture Edge"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>This is caused by the discrete nature of our texture accessing. The texture
            coordinates are all in floating-point values. The GLSL <code class="function">texture</code>
            function internally converts these texture coordinates to specific texel values within
            the texture. So what value do you get if the texture coordinate lands halfway between
            two texels?</p><p>That is governed by a process called <em class="glossterm">texture filtering</em>.
            Filtering can happen in two directions: magnification and minification. Magnification
            happens when the texture mapping makes the texture appear bigger in screen space than
            its actual resolution. If you get closer to the texture, relative to its mapping, then
            the texture is magnified relative to its natural resolution. Minification is the
            opposite: when the texture is being shrunken relative to its natural resolution.</p><p>In OpenGL, magnification and minification filtering are each set independently. That
            is what the <code class="literal">GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER</code> and
                <code class="literal">GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER</code> sampler parameters control. We are
            currently using <code class="literal">GL_NEAREST</code> for both; this is called
                <em class="glossterm">nearest filtering</em>. This mode means that each texture
            coordinate picks the texel value that it is nearest to. For our checkerboard, that means
            that we will get either black or white.</p><p>Now this may sound fine, since our texture is a checkerboard and only has two actual
            colors. However, it is exactly this discrete sampling that gives rise to the pixel crawl
            effect. A texture coordinate that is half-way between the white and the black is either
            white or black; a small change in the camera causes an instant pop from black to white
            or vice-versa.</p><p>Each fragment being rendered takes up a certain area of space on the screen: the area
            of the destination pixel for that fragment. The texture mapping of the rendered surface
            to the texture gives a texture coordinate for each point on the surface. But a pixel is
            not a single, infinitely small point on the surface; it represents some finite area of
            the surface.</p><p>Therefore, we can use the texture mapping in reverse. We can take the four corners of
            a pixel area and find the texture coordinates from them. The area of this 4-sided
            figure, in the space of the texture, is the area of the texture that is being mapped to
            that location on the screen. With a perfect texture accessing system, the value we get
            from the GLSL <code class="function">texture</code> function would be the average value of the
            colors in that area.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e14753"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;15.3.&nbsp;Nearest Sampling</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="NearestSampleDiag.svg" alt="Nearest Sampling"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The dot represents the texture coordinate's location on the texture. The box is the
            area that the fragment covers. The problem happens because a fragment area mapped into
            the texture's space may cover some white area and some black area. Since nearest only
            picks a single texel, which is either black or white, it does not accurately represent
            the mapped area of the fragment.</p><p>One obvious way to smooth out the differences is to do exactly that. Instead of
            picking a single sample for each texture coordinate, pick the nearest 4 samples and then
            interpolate the values based on how close they each are to the texture coordinate. To do
            this, we set the magnification and minification filters to
            <code class="literal">GL_LINEAR</code>.</p><pre class="programlisting">glSamplerParameteri(g_samplers[<span class="code-number">1</span>], GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
glSamplerParameteri(g_samplers[<span class="code-number">1</span>], GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);</pre><p>This is called, surprisingly enough, <em class="glossterm">linear filtering</em>. In our
            tutorial, press the <span class="keycap"><strong>2</strong></span> key to see what linear filtering looks like;

It creates a bit of
            fuzziness, but this is generally a lot easier for the viewer to tolerate than pixel
            crawl. Human vision tends to be attracted to movement, and false movement like dot crawl
            can be distracting.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tutorial 15.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Tutorial 15.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut15 Needs More Pictures.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;15.&nbsp;Many Images&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Needs More Pictures</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
