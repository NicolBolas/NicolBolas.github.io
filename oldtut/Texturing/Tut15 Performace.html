A texture with a full
            mipmap pyramid will take up ~33% more space than just the base level. So there is some
            memory overhead. The unexpected part is that this is actually a memory vs. speed
            tradeoff, as mipmapping usually improves performance.</p><p>If a texture is going to be minified significantly, providing mipmaps is a performance
            benefit. The reason is this: for a highly minified texture, the texture accesses for
            adjacent fragment shaders will be very far apart. Texture sampling units like texture
            access patterns where there is a high degree of locality, where adjacent fragment
            shaders access texels that are very near one another. The farther apart they are, the
            less useful the optimizations in the texture samplers are. Indeed, if they are far
            enough apart, those optimizations start becoming performance penalties.</p><p>Textures that are used as lookup tables should generally not use mipmaps. But other
            kinds of textures, like those that provide surface details, can and should where
            reasonable.</p><p>While mipmapping is free, linear mipmap filtering,
                <code class="literal">GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR</code>, is generally not free. But the cost of
            it is rather small these days. For those textures where mipmap interpolation makes
            sense, it should be used.</p><p>Anisotropic filtering is even more costly, as one might expect. After all, it means
            taking more texture samples to cover a particular texture area. However, anisotropic
            filtering is almost always implemented adaptively. This means that it will only take
            extra samples for fragments where it detects that this is necessary. And it will only
            take enough samples to fill out the area, up to the maximum the user provides of course.
            Therefore, turning on anisotropic filtering, even just 2x or 4x, only hurts for the
            fragments that need it.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tut15 How Mipmapping Works.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Tutorial 15.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut15 In Review.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">How Mipmap Selection Works&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;In Review</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
