            the surface of an object. But before we can do that, we need to have a discussion about
            what it means to interpolate a value across a triangle.</p><p>Thus far, we have more or less glossed over the details of interpolation. We expanded
            on this earlier when we explained why per-vertex lighting would not work for certain
            kinds of functions, as well as when explaining why normals do not interpolate well. But
            now that we want to associate vertices of a triangle with locations on a texture, we
            need to fully explain what interpolation means.</p><p>The main topic is linearity. In the earlier discussions, it was stressed that
            interpolation was linear. The question that was danced around is both simple and
            obscure: linear in what space?</p><p>The perspective projection is a non-linear transform; that's why a matrix
            multiplication is insufficient to express it. Matrices can only handle linear
            transformations, and the perspective projection needs a division, which is non-linear.
            We have seen the effect of this non-linear transformation before:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e14109"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;14.4.&nbsp;Projection and Interpolation</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="PerspectiveInterpolation.svg" alt="Projection and Interpolation"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The transformation from normalized device coordinate space to window space is fully
            linear. So the problem is the transformation from camera space to NDC space, the
            perspective projection.</p><p>From this diagram we see that lines which are parallel in camera space are not
            necessarily parallel in NDC space; this is one of the features of non-linear transforms.
            But most important of all is the fact that the distance between objects has changed
            non-linearly. In camera-space, the lines parallel to the Z axis are all equally spaced.
            In NDC space, they are not.</p><p>Look at the lines A and B. Imagine that these are the only two vertices in the object.
            In camera-space, the point halfway between them is C. However, in NDC space, the point
            halfway between them is D. The points C and D are not that close to one another in
            either space.</p><p>So, what space has OpenGL been doing our interpolation in? It might seem obvious to
            say window space, since window space is the space that the rasterizer (the hardware that
            does the interpolating) sees and uses. But if it had, we would have had a great many
            interpolation problems.</p><p>Consider interpolating camera space positions. This only works if the interpolation
            happens in camera-space (or some linear transform thereof). Look at the diagram again;
            the camera-space position C would be computed for the NDC location D. That would be very
            wrong.</p><p>So our interpolation has somehow been happening in camera space, even though the
            rasterizer only sees window space. What mechanism causes this?</p><p>The ability to linearly interpolate values in pre-projection space is called
                <em class="glossterm">perspective-correct interpolation.</em> And we now get to the
            final reason why our vertex shader provides values in clip-space rather than having the
            shader perform the perspective divide. The W term of clip-space is vital for performing
            perspective-correct interpolation.</p><p>This makes sense; the clip-space W is after all what makes our transformation
            non-linear. Perspective-correction simply uses the clip-space W to adjust the
            interpolation so that it happens in a space that is linear with respect to clip-space.
            And since clip-space is a linear transform of camera space (using 4D homogeneous
            coordinates), everything works out. Technically, perspective-correct interpolation does
            not cause interpolation in camera space, but it interpolates in a space that is a linear
            transform from camera space.</p><p>To see the effects of perspective-correction most dramatically, fire up the <span class="propername">Perspective Interpolation</span> project.</p><p>There are no camera controls in this demo; the camera is fixed so as to allow the
            illusion presented to work. Pressing the <span class="keycap"><strong>P</strong></span> key switches between
            perspective-correct interpolation and window-space linear interpolation.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e14144"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;14.5.&nbsp;Perspective Correct Interpolation</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="PerspectiveInterpolation.png" alt="Perspective Correct Interpolation"></div><div class="caption"><p>Left: Linear interpolation. Right: Perspective-correct interpolation</p></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The interesting bit is as follows. Switch to the perspective-correct version (a
            message will appear in the console window) and press the <span class="keycap"><strong>S</strong></span> key. Now,
            the <span class="keycap"><strong>P</strong></span> key no longer seems to have any effect; we seem to be trapped in
            linear-interpolation.</p><p>What happens is that the <span class="keycap"><strong>S</strong></span> key switches meshes. The
                <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">fake</span>&#8221;</span> mesh is not really a hallway; it is perfectly flat. It is more
            or less a mesh who's vertex positions are in NDC-space, after multiplying the original
            hallway by the perspective matrix. The difference is that there is no W coordinate; it's
            just a flat object, an optical illusion. There is no perspective information for the
            perspective-correction logic to key on, so it looks just like window-space linear
            interpolation.</p><p>The switch used to turn on or off perspective-correct interpolation is the
            interpolation qualifier. Previously, we said that there were three qualifiers:
                <code class="literal">flat</code>, <code class="literal">smooth</code>, and
                <code class="literal">noperspective</code>. The third one was previously left undefined
            before; you can probably guess what it does now.</p><p>We are not going to use <code class="literal">noperspective</code> in the immediate future.
            Indeed, doing window space interpolation with a perspective projection is exceedingly
            rare, far more rare than <code class="literal">flat</code>. The important thing to understand from
            this section is that interpolation style matters. And <code class="literal">smooth</code> will be
            our default interpolation; fortunately, it is OpenGL's default too.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tutorial 14.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Tutorial 14.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut14 Texture Mapping.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;14.&nbsp;Textures are not Pictures&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Texture Mapping</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
