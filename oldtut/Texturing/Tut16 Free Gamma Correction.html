            that they are automatically linearized upon being fetched from a shader. Since the sRGB
            colorspace closely approximates a gamma of 2.2, if we could use an sRGB image as the
            image we render to, we would automatically get gamma correction without having to put it
            into our shaders. But this would require two things: the ability to specify that the
            screen image is sRGB, and the ability to state that we are outputting linear values and
            want them converted to the sRGB colorspace when stored.</p><p>Naturally, OpenGL provides both of these. To see how they work, load up the last
            project, <span class="propername">Gamma Landscape</span>. This shows off some
            textured terrain with a day/night cycle and a few lights running around.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e15657"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;16.5.&nbsp;Gamma Landscape</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Gamma%20Landscape.png" alt="Gamma Landscape"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>It uses the standard mouse-based controls to move around. As before, the
                <span class="keycap"><strong>1</strong></span> and <span class="keycap"><strong>2</strong></span> keys respectively select linear mipmap
            filtering and anisotropic filtering. The main feature is the non-shader-based gamma
            correction. This is enabled by default and can be toggled by pressing the
                <span class="keycap"><strong>SpaceBar</strong></span>.</p><p><b>sRGB Screen Image.&nbsp;</b>The process for setting this up is a bit confusing, but is ultimately quite simple
                for our tutorials. The OpenGL specification specifies how to use the OpenGL
                rendering system, but it does not specify how to <span class="emphasis"><em>create</em></span> the
                OpenGL rendering system. That is relegated to platform-specific APIs. Therefore,
                while code that uses OpenGL is platform-neutral, that code is ultimately dependent
                on platform-specific initialization code to create the OpenGL context.</p><p>These tutorials rely on FreeGLUT for setting up the OpenGL context and managing the
            platform-specific APIs. The <code class="filename">framework.cpp</code> file is responsible for
            doing the initialization setup work, telling FreeGLUT exactly how we want our screen
            image set up. In order to allow different tutorials to adjust how we set up our FreeGLUT
            screen image, the framework calls the <code class="function">defaults</code> function.</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e15690"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;16.4.&nbsp;Gamma Landscape defaults Function</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-keyword">unsigned</span> <span class="code-keyword">int</span> defaults(<span class="code-keyword">unsigned</span> <span class="code-keyword">int</span> displayMode, <span class="code-keyword">int</span> &amp;width, <span class="code-keyword">int</span> &amp;height)
{
    <span class="code-keyword">return</span> displayMode | GLUT_SRGB;
}</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>The <code class="varname">displayMode</code> argument is a bitfield that contains the standard
            FreeGLUT display mode flags set up by the framework. This function must return that
            bitfield, and all of our prior tutorials have returned it unchanged. Here, we change it
            to include the <code class="literal">GLUT_SRGB</code> flag. That flag tells FreeGLUT that we want
            the screen image to be in the sRGB colorspace.</p><p><b>Linear to sRGB Conversion.&nbsp;</b>This alone is insufficient. We must also tell OpenGL that our shaders will be
                writing linear colorspace values and that these values should be converted to sRGB
                before being written to the screen. This is done with a simple
                    <code class="function">glEnable</code> command:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e15711"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;16.5.&nbsp;Enable sRGB Conversion</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-keyword">if</span>(g_useGammaDisplay)
    glEnable(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SRGB);
<span class="code-keyword">else</span>
    glDisable(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SRGB);</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>The need for this is not entirely obvious, especially since we cannot manually turn
            off sRGB-to-linear conversion when reading from textures. The ability to disable
            linear-to-sRGB conversion for screen rendering is useful when we are drawing something
            directly in the sRGB colorspace. For example, it is often useful to have parts of the
            interface drawn directly in the sRGB colorspace, while the actual scene being rendered
            uses color conversion.</p><p>Note that the color conversion is just as free in terms of performance as it is for
            texture reads. So you should not fear using this as much and as often as
            reasonable.</p><p>Having this automatic gamma correction is better than manual gamma correction because
            it covers everything that is written to the screen. In prior tutorials, we had to
            manually gamma correct the clear color and certain other colors used to render solid
            objects. Here, we simply enable the conversion and everything is affected.</p><p>The process of ensuring a linear pipeline from texture creation, through lighting,
            through to the screen is commonly called <em class="glossterm">gamma-correct texturing.</em>
            The name is a bit of a misnomer, as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">texturing</span>&#8221;</span> is not a requirement; we
            have been gamma-correct since Tutorial 12's introduction of that concept (except for
            Tutorial 15, where we looked at filtering). However, textures are the primary source of
            potential failures to maintain a linear pipeline, as many image formats on disc have no
            way of saying if the image data is in sRGB or linear. So the name still makes some
            sense.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tut16 Mipmaps and Linearity.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Tutorial 16.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut16 In Review.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">sRGB and Mipmaps&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;In Review</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
