Do not worry if you do not understand
            everything right away; every step will be covered in lavish detail in later
            tutorials.</p><p>Everything you see on your computer's screen, even the text you are reading right now
            (assuming you are reading this on an electronic display device, rather than a printout)
            is simply a two-dimensional array of pixels. If you take a screenshot of something on
            your screen, and blow it up, it will look very blocky.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e557"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;8.&nbsp;An Image</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="PixelImage.svg" alt="An Image"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Each of these blocks is a <em class="glossterm">pixel</em>. The word <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">pixel</span>&#8221;</span>
            is derived from the term <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote"><acronym class="acronym">Pic</acronym>ture
                <acronym class="acronym">El</acronym>ement</span>&#8221;</span>. Every pixel on your screen has a particular
            color. A two-dimensional array of pixels is called an
            <em class="glossterm">image</em>.</p><p>The purpose of graphics of any kind is therefore to determine what color to put in
            what pixels. This determination is what makes text look like text, windows look like
            windows, and so forth.</p><p>Since all graphics are just a two-dimensional array of pixels, how does 3D work? 3D
            graphics is thus a system of producing colors for pixels that convince you that the
            scene you are looking at is a 3D world rather than a 2D image. The process of converting
            a 3D world into a 2D image of that world is called
            <em class="glossterm">rendering.</em></p><p>There are several methods for rendering a 3D world. The process used by real-time
            graphics hardware, such as that found in your computer, involves a very great deal of
            fakery. This process is called <em class="glossterm">rasterization,</em> and a rendering
            system that uses rasterization is called a <em class="glossterm">rasterizer.</em></p><p>In rasterizers, all objects that you see are empty shells. There are techniques that
            are used to allow you to cut open these empty shells, but this simply replaces part of
            the shell with another shell that shows what the inside looks like. Everything is a
            shell.</p><p>All of these shells are made of triangles. Even surfaces that appear to be round are
            merely triangles if you look closely enough. There are techniques that generate more
            triangles for objects that appear closer or larger, so that the viewer can almost never
            see the faceted silhouette of the object. But they are always made of triangles.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Some rasterizers use planar quadrilaterals: four-sided objects, where all of the
                points lie in the same plane. One of the reasons that hardware-based rasterizers
                always use triangles is that all of the lines of a triangle are guaranteed to be in
                the same plane. Knowing this makes the rasterization process less
                complicated.</p></div><p>An object is made out of a series of adjacent triangles that define the outer surface
            of the object. Such series of triangles are often called
            <em class="glossterm">geometry</em>, a <em class="glossterm">model</em> or a
                <em class="glossterm">mesh</em>. These terms are used interchangeably.</p><p>The process of rasterization has several phases. These phases are ordered into a
            pipeline, where triangles enter from the top and a 2D image is filled in at the bottom.
            This is one of the reasons why rasterization is so amenable to hardware acceleration: it
            operates on each triangle one at a time, in a specific order. Triangles can be fed into
            the top of the pipeline while triangles that were sent earlier can still be in some
            phase of rasterization.</p><p>The order in which triangles and the various meshes are submitted to the rasterizer
            can affect its output. Always remember that, no matter how you submit the triangular
            mesh data, the rasterizer will process each triangle in a specific order, drawing the
            next one only when the previous triangle has finished being drawn.</p><p>OpenGL is an API for accessing a hardware-based rasterizer. As such, it conforms to
            the model for rasterization-based 3D renderers. A rasterizer receives a sequence of
            triangles from the user, performs operations on them, and writes pixels based on this
            triangle data. This is a simplification of how rasterization works in OpenGL, but it is
            useful for our purposes.</p><p><b>Triangles and Vertices.&nbsp;</b>Triangles consist of 3 vertices. A <em class="glossterm">vertex</em> is a
                collection of arbitrary data. For the sake of simplicity (we will expand upon this
                later), let us say that this data must contain a point in three dimensional space.
                It may contain other data, but it must have at least this. Any 3 points that are not
                on the same line create a triangle, so the smallest information for a triangle
                consists of 3 three-dimensional points.</p><p>A point in 3D space is defined by 3 numbers or coordinates. An X coordinate, a Y
            coordinate, and a Z coordinate. These are commonly written with parenthesis, as in (X,
            Y, Z).</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e629"></a>Rasterization Overview</h3></div></div></div><p>The rasterization pipeline, particularly for modern hardware, is very complex.
                This is a very simplified overview of this pipeline. It is necessary to have a
                simple understanding of the pipeline before we look at the details of rendering
                things with OpenGL. Those details can be overwhelming without a high level
                overview.</p><p><b>Clip Space Transformation.&nbsp;</b>The first phase of rasterization is to transform the vertices of each triangle
                    into a certain region of space. Everything within this volume will be rendered
                    to the output image, and everything that falls outside of this region will not
                    be. This region corresponds to the view of the world that the user wants to
                    render.</p><p>The volume that the triangle is transformed into is called, in OpenGL parlance,
                    <em class="glossterm">clip space</em>. The positions of the triangle's vertices in
                clip space are called <em class="glossterm">clip coordinates.</em></p><p>Clip coordinates are a little different from regular positions. A position in 3D
                space has 3 coordinates. A position in clip space has <span class="emphasis"><em>four</em></span>
                coordinates. The first three are the usual X, Y, Z positions; the fourth is called
                W. This last coordinate actually defines what the extents of clip space are for this
                vertex.</p><p>Clip space can actually be different for different vertices within a triangle. It
                is a region of 3D space on the range [-W, W] in each of the X, Y, and Z directions.
                So vertices with a different W coordinate are in a different clip space cube from
                other vertices. Since each vertex can have an independent W component, each vertex
                of a triangle exists in its own clip space.</p><p>In clip space, the positive X direction is to the right, the positive Y direction
                is up, and the positive Z direction is away from the viewer.</p><p>The process of transforming vertex positions into clip space is quite arbitrary.
                OpenGL provides a lot of flexibility in this step. We will cover this step in detail
                throughout the tutorials.</p><p>Because clip space is the visible transformed version of the world, any triangles
                that fall outside of this region are discarded. Any triangles that are partially
                outside of this region undergo a process called <em class="glossterm">clipping.</em>
                This breaks the triangle apart into a number of smaller triangles, such that the
                smaller triangles are all entirely within clip space. Hence the name <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">clip
                    space.</span>&#8221;</span></p><p><b>Normalized Coordinates.&nbsp;</b>Clip space is interesting, but inconvenient. The extent of this space is
                    different for each vertex, which makes visualizing a triangle rather difficult.
                    Therefore, clip space is transformed into a more reasonable coordinate space:
                        <em class="glossterm">normalized device coordinates</em>.</p><p>This process is very simple. The X, Y, and Z of each vertex's position is divided
                by W to get normalized device coordinates. That is all.</p><p>The space of normalized device coordinates is essentially just clip space, except
                that the range of X, Y and Z are [-1, 1]. The directions are all the same. The
                division by W is an important part of projecting 3D triangles onto 2D images; we
                will cover that in a future tutorial.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e676"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;9.&nbsp;Normalized Device Coordinate Space</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="NormDeviceCoord.svg" alt="Normalized Device Coordinate Space"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The cube indicates the boundaries of normalized device coordinate space.</p><p><a name="tut00_window_space"></a><b>Window Transformation.&nbsp;</b>The next phase of rasterization is to transform the vertices of each triangle
                    again. This time, they are converted from normalized device coordinates to
                        <em class="glossterm">window coordinates</em>. As the name suggests, window
                    coordinates are relative to the window that OpenGL is running within.</p><p>Even though they refer to the window, they are still three dimensional
                coordinates. The X goes to the right, Y goes up, and Z goes away, just as for clip
                space. The only difference is that the bounds for these coordinates depends on the
                viewable window. It should also be noted that while these are in window coordinates,
                none of the precision is lost. These are not integer coordinates; they are still
                floating-point values, and thus they have precision beyond that of a single
                pixel.</p><p>The bounds for Z are [0, 1], with 0 being the closest and 1 being the farthest.
                Vertex positions outside of this range are not visible.</p><p>Note that window coordinates have the bottom-left position as the (0, 0) origin
                point. This is counter to what users are used to in window coordinates, which is
                having the top-left position be the origin. There are transform tricks you can play
                to allow you to work in a top-left coordinate space if you need to.</p><p>The full details of this process will be discussed at length as the tutorials
                progress.</p><p><b>Scan Conversion.&nbsp;</b>After converting the coordinates of a triangle to window coordinates, the
                    triangle undergoes a process called <em class="glossterm">scan conversion.</em> This
                    process takes the triangle and breaks it up based on the arrangement of window
                    pixels over the output image that the triangle covers.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e708"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Scan Converted Triangle</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="TriangleScanConvert.svg" alt="Scan Converted Triangle"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The center image shows the digital grid of output pixels; the circles represent
                the center of each pixel. The center of each pixel represents a
                    <em class="glossterm">sample</em>: a discrete location within the area of a pixel.
                During scan conversion, a triangle will produce a <em class="glossterm">fragment</em>
                for every pixel sample that is within the 2D area of the triangle.</p><p>The image on the right shows the fragments generated by the scan conversion of the
                triangle. This creates a rough approximation of the triangle's general shape.</p><p>It is very often the case that triangles are rendered that share edges. OpenGL
                offers a guarantee that, so long as the shared edge vertex positions are
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>identical</em></span>, there will be no sample gaps during scan
                conversion.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e729"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;11.&nbsp;Shared Edge Scan Conversion</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="SharedEdgeScanConvert.svg" alt="Shared Edge Scan Conversion"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>To make it easier to use this, OpenGL also offers the guarantee that if you pass
                the same input vertex data through the same vertex processor, you will get identical
                output; this is called the <em class="glossterm">invariance guarantee</em>. So the onus
                is on the user to use the same input vertices in order to ensure gap-less scan
                conversion.</p><p>Scan conversion is an inherently 2D operation. This process only uses the X and Y
                position of the triangle in window coordinates to determine which fragments to
                generate. The Z value is not forgotten, but it is not directly part of the actual
                process of scan converting the triangle.</p><p>The result of scan converting a triangle is a sequence of fragments that cover the
                shape of the triangle. Each fragment has certain data associated with it. This data
                contains the 2D location of the fragment in window coordinates, as well as the Z
                position of the fragment. This Z value is known as the depth of the fragment. There
                may be other information that is part of a fragment, and we will expand on that in
                later tutorials.</p><p><b>Fragment Processing.&nbsp;</b>This phase takes a fragment from a scan converted triangle and transforms it
                    into one or more color values and a single depth value. The order that fragments
                    from a single triangle are processed in is irrelevant; since a single triangle
                    lies in a single plane, fragments generated from it cannot possibly overlap.
                    However, the fragments from another triangle can possibly overlap. Since order
                    is important in a rasterizer, the fragments from one triangle must all be
                    processed before the fragments from another triangle.</p><p>This phase is quite arbitrary. The user of OpenGL has a lot of options of how to
                decide what color to assign a fragment. We will cover this step in detail throughout
                the tutorials.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Direct3D Note</h3><p>Direct3D prefers to call this stage <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">pixel processing</span>&#8221;</span> or
                        <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">pixel shading</span>&#8221;</span>. This is a misnomer for several reasons. First,
                    a pixel's final color can be composed of the results of multiple fragments
                    generated by multiple <span class="emphasis"><em>samples</em></span> within a single pixel. This
                    is a common technique to remove jagged edges of triangles. Also, the fragment
                    data has not been written to the image, so it is not a pixel yet. Indeed, the
                    fragment processing step can conditionally prevent rendering of a fragment based
                    on arbitrary computations. Thus a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">pixel</span>&#8221;</span> in D3D parlance may never
                    actually become a pixel at all.</p></div><p><b>Fragment Writing.&nbsp;</b>After generating one or more colors and a depth value, the fragment is written
                    to the destination image. This step involves more than simply writing to the
                    destination image. Combining the color and depth with the colors that are
                    currently in the image can involve a number of computations. These will be
                    covered in detail in various tutorials.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e773"></a>Colors</h3></div></div></div><p>Previously, a pixel was stated to be an element in a 2D image that has a
                particular color. A color can be described in many ways.</p><p>In computer graphics, the usual description of a color is as a series of numbers
                on the range [0, 1]. Each of the numbers corresponds to the intensity of a
                particular reference color; thus the final color represented by the series of
                numbers is a mix of these reference colors.</p><p>The set of reference colors is called a <em class="glossterm">colorspace</em>. The
                most common color space for screens is RGB, where the reference colors are Red,
                Green and Blue. Printed works tend to use CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black). Since
                we're dealing with rendering to a screen, and because OpenGL requires it, we will
                use the RGB colorspace.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>You can play some fancy games with programmatic shaders (see below) that allow
                    you to work in different colorspaces. So technically, we only have to output to
                    a linear RGB colorspace.</p></div><p>So a pixel in OpenGL is defined as 3 values on the range [0, 1] that represent a
                color in a linear RGB colorspace. By combining different intensities of this 3
                colors, we can generate millions of different color shades. This will get extended
                slightly, as we deal with transparency later.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e790"></a>Shader</h3></div></div></div><p>A <em class="glossterm">shader</em> is a program designed to be run on a renderer as
                part of the rendering operation. Regardless of the kind of rendering system in use,
                shaders can only be executed at certain points in that rendering process. These
                    <em class="glossterm">shader stages</em> represent hooks where a user can add
                arbitrary algorithms to create a specific visual effect.</p><p>In term of rasterization as outlined above, there are several shader stages where
                arbitrary processing is both economical for performance and offers high utility to
                the user. For example, the transformation of an incoming vertex to clip space is a
                useful hook for user-defined code, as is the processing of a fragment into final
                colors and depth.</p><p>Shaders for OpenGL are run on the actual rendering hardware. This can often free
                up valuable CPU time for other tasks, or simply perform operations that would be
                difficult if not impossible without the flexibility of executing arbitrary code. A
                downside of this is that they must live within certain limits that CPU code would
                not have to.</p><p>There are a number of shading languages available to various APIs. The one used in
                this tutorial is the primary shading language of OpenGL. It is called,
                unimaginatively, the OpenGL Shading Language, or <acronym class="acronym">GLSL</acronym>. for short.
                It looks deceptively like C, but it is very much <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> C.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Introduction.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Introduction.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Intro What is OpenGL.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Introduction&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;What is OpenGL</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
