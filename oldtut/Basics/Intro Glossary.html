The number of
                        values stored in a vector is its dimensionality. Vectors can have math
                        operations performed on them as a whole.</p></dd><dt>scalar</dt><dd><p>A single, non-vector value. A one-dimensional vector can be considered a
                        scalar.</p></dd><dt>vector position</dt><dd><p>A vector that represents a position.</p></dd><dt>vector direction</dt><dd><p>A vector that represents a direction.</p></dd><dt>vector component</dt><dd><p>One of the values within a vector.</p></dd><dt>component-wise operation</dt><dd><p>An operation on a vector that applies something to each component of the
                        vector. The results of a component-wise operation is a vector of the same
                        dimension as the input(s) to the operation. Many vector operations are
                        component-wise.</p></dd><dt>unit vector</dt><dd><p>A vector who's length is exactly one. These represent purely directional
                        vectors.</p></dd><dt>vector normalization</dt><dd><p>The process of converting a vector into a unit vector that points in the
                        same direction as the original vector.</p></dd><dt>pixel</dt><dd><p>The smallest division of a digital image. A pixel has a particular color in a
                        particular colorspace.</p></dd><dt>image</dt><dd><p>A two-dimensional array of pixels.</p></dd><dt>rendering</dt><dd><p>The process of taking the source 3D world and converting it into a 2D image
                        that represents a view of that world from a particular angle.</p></dd><dt>rasterization</dt><dd><p>A particular rendering method, used to convert a series of 3D triangles into a
                        2D image.</p></dd><dt>geometry, model, mesh</dt><dd><p>A single object in 3D space made of triangles.</p></dd><dt>vertex</dt><dd><p>One of the 3 elements that make up a triangle. Vertices can contain arbitrary
                        of data, but among that data is a 3-dimensional position representing the
                        location of the vertex in 3D space.</p></dd><dt>clip space, clip coordinates</dt><dd><p>A region of three-dimensional space into which vertex positions are
                        transformed. These vertex positions are 4 dimensional quantities. The fourth
                        component (W) of clip coordinates represents the visible range of clip space for
                        that vertex. So the X, Y, and Z component of clip coordinates must be between
                        [-W, W] to be a visible part of the world.</p><p>In clip space, positive X goes right, positive Y up, and positive Z
                        away.</p><p>Clip-space vertices are output by the vertex processing stage of the rendering
                        pipeline.</p></dd><dt>clipping</dt><dd><p>The process of taking a triangle in clip coordinates and splitting it if
                        one or more of its vertices is outside of clip space.</p></dd><dt>normalized device coordinates</dt><dd><p>These are clip coordinates that have been divided by their fourth component.
                        This makes this range of space the same for all components. Vertices with
                        positions on the range [-1, 1] are visible, and other vertices are not.</p></dd><dt>window space, window coordinates</dt><dd><p>A region of three-dimensional space that normalized device coordinates are
                        mapped to. The X and Y positions of vertices in this space are relative to the
                        destination image. The origin is in the bottom-left, with positive X going right
                        and positive Y going up. The Z value is a number on the range [0, 1], where 0 is
                        the closest value and 1 is the farthest. Vertex positions outside of this range
                        are not visible.</p></dd><dt>scan conversion</dt><dd><p>The process of taking a triangle in window space and converting it into a
                        number of fragments based on projecting it onto the pixels of the output
                        image.</p></dd><dt>sample</dt><dd><p>A discrete location within the bounds of a pixel that determines whether to
                        generate a fragment from scan converting the triangle. The area of a single
                        pixel can have multiple samples, which can generate multiple fragments.</p></dd><dt>fragment</dt><dd><p>A single element of a scan converted triangle. A fragment can contain
                        arbitrary data, but among that data is a 3-dimensional position, identifying the
                        location on the triangle in window space where this fragment originates
                        from.</p></dd><dt>invariance guarantee</dt><dd><p>A guarantee provided by OpenGL, such that if you provide binary-identical
                        inputs to the vertex processing, while all other state remains exactly
                        identical, then the exact same vertex in clip-space will be output.</p></dd><dt>colorspace</dt><dd><p>The set of reference colors that define a way of representing a color in
                        computer graphics, and the function mapping between those reference colors
                        and the actual colors. All colors are defined relative to a particular
                        colorspace.</p></dd><dt>shader</dt><dd><p>A program designed to be executed by a renderer, in order to perform some
                        user-defined operations.</p></dd><dt>shader stage</dt><dd><p>A particular place in a rendering pipeline where a shader can be executed
                        to perform a computation. The results of this computation will be fed to the
                        next stage in the rendering pipeline.</p></dd><dt>OpenGL</dt><dd><p>A specification that defines the effective behavior of a
                        rasterization-based rendering system.</p></dd><dt>OpenGL context</dt><dd><p>A specific set of state used for rendering. The OpenGL context is like a
                        large C-style struct that contains a large number of fields that can be
                        accessed. If you were to create multiple windows for rendering, each one
                        would have its own OpenGL context.</p></dd><dt>object binding</dt><dd><p>Objects can be bound to a particular location in the OpenGL context. When
                        this happens, the state within the object takes the place of a certain set
                        of state in the context. There are multiple binding points for objects, and
                        each kind of object can be bound to certain binding points. Which bind point
                        an object is bound to determines what state the object overrides.</p></dd><dt>Architectural Review Board</dt><dd><p>The body of the Khronos Group that governs the OpenGL
                        specification.</p></dd><dt>OpenGL Implementation</dt><dd><p>The software that implements the OpenGL specification for a particular
                        system.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Intro What is OpenGL.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Introduction.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tutorial 01.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">What is OpenGL&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Chapter&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Hello, Triangle!</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
