        section. Here, we will be discussing vector math, graphical rendering theory, and OpenGL.
        This serves as a primer to the rest of the book.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e327"></a>Vector Math</h2></div></div></div><p>This book assumes that you are familiar with algebra and geometry, but not necessarily
            with vector math. Later material will bring you up to speed on more complex subjects,
            but this will introduce the basics of vector math.</p><p>A <em class="glossterm">vector</em> can have many meanings, depending on whether we are
            talking geometrically or numerically. In either case, vectors have dimensionality; this
            represents the number of dimensions that the vector has. A two-dimensional vector is
            restricted to a single plane, while a three-dimensional vector can point in any physical
            space. Vectors can have higher dimensions, but generally we only deal with dimensions
            between 2 and 4.</p><p>Technically, a vector can have only one dimension. Such a vector is called a
                <em class="glossterm">scalar.</em></p><p>In terms of geometry, a vector can represent one of two concepts: a position or a
            direction within a particular space. A vector <em class="glossterm">position</em> represents
            a specific location in space. For example, on this graph, we have a vector position
            A:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e346"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Position Vectors</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="VectorPosition.svg" alt="Position Vectors"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>A vector can also represent a <em class="glossterm">direction</em>. Direction vectors do
            not have an origin; they simply specify a direction in space. These are all direction
            vectors, but the vectors B and D are the same, even though they are drawn in different
            locations:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e357"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Direction Vectors</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="VectorDirections.svg" alt="Direction Vectors"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>That's all well and good for geometry, but vectors can also be described numerically.
            A vector in this case is a sequence of numbers, one for each dimension. So a
            two-dimensional vector has two numbers; a three-dimensional vector has three. And so
            forth. Scalars, numerically speaking, are just a single number.</p><p>Each of the numbers within a vector is called a <em class="glossterm">component</em>. Each
            component usually has a name. For our purposes, the first component of a vector is the X
            component. The second component is the Y component, the third is the Z, and if there is
            a fourth, it is called W.</p><p>When writing vectors in text, they are written with parenthesis. So a 3D vector could
            be (0, 2, 4); the X component is 0, the Y component is 2, and the Z component is 4. When
            writing them as part of an equation, they are written as follows:</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="ColumnVector.svg"></div></div><p>In math equations, vector variables are either in boldface or written with an arrow
            over them.</p><p>When drawing vectors graphically, one makes a distinction between position vectors and
            direction vectors. However, numerically there is <span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> difference
            between the two. The only difference is in how you use them, not how you represent them
            with numbers. So you could consider a position a direction and then apply some vector
            operation to them, and then consider the result a position again.</p><p>Though vectors have individual numerical components, a vector as a whole can have a
            number of mathematical operations applied to them. We will show a few of them, with both
            their geometric and numerical representations.</p><p><b>Vector Addition.&nbsp;</b>You can take two vectors and add them together. Graphically, this works as
            follows:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e390"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Vector Addition</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="VectorAddition.svg" alt="Vector Addition"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Remember that vector directions can be shifted around without changing their
                values. So if you put two vectors head to tail, the vector sum is simply the
                direction from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e398"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Vector Addition Head-to-Tail</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="VectorAdditionHeads.svg" alt="Vector Addition Head-to-Tail"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Numerically, the sum of two vectors is just the sum of the corresponding
                components:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e406"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Vector Addition with Numbers</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="VectorAdditionNum.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>Any operation where you perform an operation on each component of a vector is
                called a <em class="glossterm">component-wise operation</em>. Vector addition is
                component-wise. Any component-wise operation on two vectors requires that the two
                vectors have the same dimensionality.</p><p><b>Vector Negation and Subtraction.&nbsp;</b>You can negate a vector. This reverses its direction:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e422"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Vector Negation</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="VectorNegation.svg" alt="Vector Negation"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Numerically, this means negating each component of the vector.</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e430"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Vector Negation</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="VectorNegationNum.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>Just as with scalar math, vector subtraction is the same as addition with the
            negation of the second vector.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e438"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Vector Subtraction</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="VectorSubtraction.svg" alt="Vector Subtraction"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p><b>Vector Multiplication.&nbsp;</b>Vector multiplication is one of the few vector operations that has no real
                geometric equivalent. To multiply a direction by another, or multiplying a position
                by another position, does not really make sense. That does not mean that the numerical
                equivalent is not useful, though.</p><p>Multiplying two vectors numerically is simply component-wise multiplication, much like
            vector addition.</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e451"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Vector Multiplication</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="VectorMultiplicationNum.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p><b>Vector/Scalar Operations.&nbsp;</b>Vectors can be operated on by scalar values. Recall that scalars are just single
                numbers. Vectors can be multiplied by scalars. This magnifies or shrinks the length
                of the vector, depending on the scalar value.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e462"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Vector Scaling</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="VectorScalarMult.svg" alt="Vector Scaling"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Numerically, this is a component-wise multiplication, where each component of the
            vector is multiplied with each component of the scalar.</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e470"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Vector-Scalar Multiplication</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="VectorScalarMultNum.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>Scalars can also be added to vectors. This, like vector-to-vector multiplication, has
            no geometric representation. It is a component-wise addition of the scalar with each
            component of the vector.</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e478"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Vector-Scalar Addition</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="VectorScalarAddNum.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p><b>Vector Algebra.&nbsp;</b>It is useful to know a bit about the relationships between these kinds of vector
                operations.</p><p>Vector addition and multiplication follow many of the same rules for scalar addition
            and multiplication. They are commutative, associative, and distributive.</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e491"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Vector Algebra</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="VectorMathProperties.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>Vector/scalar operations have similar properties.</p><p><b>Length.&nbsp;</b>Vectors have a length. The length of a vector direction is the distance from the
                starting point to the ending point.</p><p>Numerically, computing the distance requires this equation:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e506"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Vector Length</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="VectorLengthNum.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>This uses the Pythagorean theorem to compute the length of the vector. This works for
            vectors of arbitrary dimensions, not just two or three.</p><p><b>Unit Vectors and Normalization.&nbsp;</b>A vector that has a length of exactly one is called a <em class="glossterm">unit
                    vector.</em> This represents a pure direction with a standard, unit
                length. A unit vector variable in math equations is written with a ^ over the
                variable name.</p><p>A vector can be converted into a unit vector by <em class="glossterm">normalizing</em> it.
            This is done by dividing the vector by its length. Or rather, multiplication by the
            reciprocal of the length.</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e527"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Vector Normalization</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="VectorNormalizationNum.svg"></div></div></div><br class="equation-break"><p>This is not all of the vector math that we will use in these tutorials. New vector
            math operations will be introduced and explained as needed when they are first used. And
            unlike the math operations introduced here, most of them are not component-wise
            operations.</p><p><b>Range Notation.&nbsp;</b>This book will frequently use standard notation to specify that a value must be
                within a certain range.</p><p>If a value is constrained between 0 and 1, and it may actually have the values 0 and
            1, then it is said to be <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">on the range</span>&#8221;</span> [0, 1]. The square brackets mean
            that the range includes the value next to it.</p><p>If a value is constrained between 0 and 1, but it may not actually have a value of 0,
            then it is said to be on the range (0, 1]. The parenthesis means that the range does not
            include that value.</p><p>If a value is constrained to 0 or any number greater than zero, then the infinity
            notation will be used. This range is represented by [0, &#8734;). Note that infinity can never
            be reached, so it is always exclusive. A constraint to any number less than zero, but
            not including zero would be on the range (-&#8734;, 0).</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Basics.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Basics.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Intro Graphics and Rendering.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Part&nbsp;I.&nbsp;The Basics&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Graphics and Rendering</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
