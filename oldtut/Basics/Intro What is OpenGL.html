            what it is that we are writing. What exactly is OpenGL?</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e819"></a>OpenGL as an API</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="glossterm">OpenGL</em> is usually thought of as an Application Programming
                Interface (<acronym class="acronym">API</acronym>). The OpenGL API has been exposed to a number of
                languages. But the one that they all ultimately use at their lowest level is the C
                API.</p><p>The API, in C, is defined by a number of typedefs, #defined enumerator values, and
                functions. The typedefs define basic GL types like <span class="type">GLint</span>,
                    <span class="type">GLfloat</span> and so forth. These are defined to have a specific bit
                depth.</p><p><a name="OpenGLObjects"></a>Complex aggregates like structs are never directly exposed
                in OpenGL. Any such constructs are hidden behind the API. This makes it easier to
                expose the OpenGL API to non-C languages without having a complex conversion
                layer.</p><p>In C++, if you wanted an object that contained an integer, a float, and a string,
                you would create it and access it like this:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-keyword">struct</span> Object
{
    <span class="code-keyword">int</span> count;
    <span class="code-keyword">float</span> opacity;
    <span class="code-keyword">char</span> *name;
};

<span class="code-comment">//Create the storage for the object.</span>
Object newObject;

<span class="code-comment">//Put data into the object.</span>
newObject.count = <span class="code-number">5</span>;
newObject.opacity = <span class="code-number">0.4f</span>;
newObject.name = <span class="code-string">"Some String"</span>;
</pre><p>In OpenGL, you would use an API that looks more like this:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-comment">//Create the storage for the object</span>
GLuint objectName;
glGenObject(<span class="code-number">1</span>, &amp;objectName);

<span class="code-comment">//Put data into the object.</span>
glBindObject(GL_MODIFY, objectName);
glObjectParameteri(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_COUNT, <span class="code-number">5</span>);
glObjectParameterf(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_OPACITY, <span class="code-number">0.4f</span>);
glObjectParameters(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_NAME, <span class="code-string">"Some String"</span>);</pre><p>None of these are actual OpenGL commands, of course. This is simply an example of
                what the interface to such an object would look like.</p><p>OpenGL owns the storage for all OpenGL objects. Because of this, the user can only
                access an object by reference. Almost all OpenGL objects are referred to by an
                unsigned integer (the <span class="type">GLuint</span>). Objects are created by a function of the
                form <code class="function">glGen*</code>, where * is the type of the object. The first
                parameter is the number of objects to create, and the second is a
                    <span class="type">GLuint*</span> array that receives the newly created object names.</p><p>To modify most objects, they must first be bound to the context. Many objects can
                be bound to different locations in the context; this allows the same object to be
                used in different ways. These different locations are called
                    <em class="glossterm">targets</em>; all objects have a list of valid targets, and
                some have only one. In the above example, the fictitious target
                    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">GL_MODIFY</span>&#8221;</span> is the location where <code class="varname">objectName</code> is
                bound.</p><p>The enumerators <code class="literal">GL_OBJECT_*</code> all name fields in the object that
                can be set. The <code class="function">glObjectParameter</code> family of functions set
                parameters within the object bound to the given target. Note that since OpenGL is a
                C API, it has to name each of the differently typed variations differently. So there
                is <code class="function">glObjectParameteri</code> for integer parameters,
                    <code class="function">glObjectParameterf</code> for floating-point parameters, and so
                forth.</p><p>Note that all OpenGL objects are not as simple as this example, and the functions
                that change object state do not all follow these naming conventions. Also, exactly
                what it means to bind an object to the context is explained below.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e887"></a>The Structure of OpenGL</h3></div></div></div><p>The OpenGL API is defined as a state machine. Almost all of the OpenGL functions
                set or retrieve some state in OpenGL. The only functions that do not change state
                are functions that use the currently set state to cause rendering to happen.</p><p>You can think of the state machine as a very large struct with a great many
                different fields. This struct is called the <em class="glossterm">OpenGL context</em>,
                and each field in the context represents some information necessary for
                rendering.</p><p>Objects in OpenGL are thus defined as a list of fields in this struct that can be
                saved and restored. <em class="glossterm">Binding</em> an object to a target within the
                context causes the data in this object to replace some of the context's state. Thus
                after the binding, future function calls that read from or modify this context state
                will read or modify the state within the object.</p><p>Objects are usually represented as <span class="type">GLuint</span> integers; these are handles
                to the actual OpenGL objects. The integer value 0 is special; it acts as the object
                equivalent of a NULL pointer. Binding object 0 means to unbind the currently bound
                object. This means that the original context state, the state that was in place
                before the binding took place, now becomes the context state.</p><p>Let us say that this represents some part of an OpenGL context's state:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e909"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;1.&nbsp;OpenGL Object State</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-keyword">struct</span> Values
{
    <span class="code-keyword">int</span> iValue1;
    <span class="code-keyword">int</span> iValue2;
};

<span class="code-keyword">struct</span> OpenGL_Context
{
    ...
    Values *pMainValues;
    Values *pOtherValues;
    ...
};

OpenGL_Context context;</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>To create a <code class="classname">Values</code> object, you would call something like
                    <code class="function">glGenValues</code>. You could bind the
                    <code class="classname">Values</code> object to one of two targets:
                    <code class="literal">GL_MAIN_VALUES</code> which represents the pointer
                    <code class="varname">context.pMainValues</code>, and <code class="literal">GL_OTHER_VALUES</code>
                which represents the pointer <code class="varname">context.pOtherValues</code>. You would bind
                the object with a call to <code class="function">glBindValues</code>, passing one of the two
                targets and the object. This would set that target's pointer to the object that you
                created.</p><p>There would be a function to set values in a bound object. Say,
                    <code class="function">glValueParam</code>. It would take the target of the object, which
                represents the pointer in the context. It would also take an enum representing which
                value in the object to change. The value <code class="literal">GL_VALUE_ONE</code> would
                represent <code class="varname">iValue1</code>, and <code class="literal">GL_VALUE_TWO</code> would
                represent <code class="varname">iValue2</code>.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e957"></a>The OpenGL Specification</h3></div></div></div><p>To be technical about it, OpenGL is not an API; it is a specification. A document.
                The C API is merely one way to implement the spec. The specification defines the
                initial OpenGL state, what each function does to change or retrieve that state, and
                what is supposed to happen when you call a rendering function.</p><p>The specification is written by the OpenGL <em class="glossterm">Architectural Review
                    Board</em> (<acronym class="acronym">ARB</acronym>), a group of representatives from
                companies like Apple, NVIDIA, and AMD (the ATI part), among others. The ARB is part
                of the <a class="link" href="http://www.khronos.org/" target="_top">Khronos Group</a>.</p><p>The specification is a very complicated and technical document. However, parts of
                it are quite readable, though you will usually need at least some understanding of
                what should be going on to understand it. If you try to read it, the most important
                thing to understand about it is this: it describes <span class="emphasis"><em>results</em></span>, not
                implementation. Just because the spec says that X will happen does not mean that it
                actually does. What it means is that the user should not be able to tell the
                difference. If a piece of hardware can provide the same behavior in a different way,
                then the specification allows this, so long as the user can never tell the
                difference.</p><p><b>OpenGL Implementations.&nbsp;</b>While the OpenGL ARB does control the specification, it does not control
                    OpenGL's code. OpenGL is not something you download from a centralized location.
                    For any particular piece of hardware, it is up to the developers of that
                    hardware to write an <em class="glossterm">OpenGL Implementation</em> for that
                    hardware. Implementations, as the name suggests, implement the OpenGL
                    specification, exposing the OpenGL API as defined in the spec.</p><p>Who controls the OpenGL implementation is different for different operating
                systems. On Windows, OpenGL implementations are controlled virtually entirely by the
                hardware makers themselves. On Mac OSX, OpenGL implementations are controlled by
                Apple; they decide what version of OpenGL is exposed and what additional
                functionality can be provided to the user. Apple writes much of the OpenGL
                implementation on Mac OSX, which the hardware developers writing to an Apple-created
                internal driver API. On Linux, things are... complicated.</p><p>The long and short of this is that if you are writing a program and it seems to be
                exhibiting off-spec behavior, that is the fault of the maker of your OpenGL
                implementation (assuming it is not a bug in your code). On Windows, the various
                graphics hardware makers put their OpenGL implementations in their regular drivers.
                So if you suspect a bug in their implementation, the first thing you should do is
                make sure your graphics drivers are up-to-date; the bug may have been corrected
                since the last time you updated your drivers.</p><p><b>OpenGL Versions.&nbsp;</b>There are many versions of the OpenGL Specification. OpenGL versions are not
                    like most Direct3D versions, which typically change most of the API. Code that
                    works on one version of OpenGL will almost always work on later versions of
                    OpenGL.</p><p>The only exception to this deals with OpenGL 3.0 and above, relative to previous
                versions. v3.0 deprecated a number of older functions, and v3.1 removed most of
                those functions from the API<sup>[<a name="d0e997" href="#ftn.d0e997" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup>. This also divided the specification into 2 variations (called
                profiles): core and compatibility. The compatibility profile retains all of the
                functions removed in 3.1, while the core profile does not. Theoretically, OpenGL
                implementations could implement just the core profile; this would leave software
                that relies on the compatibility profile non-functional on that
                implementation.</p><p>As a practical matter, none of this matters at all. No OpenGL driver developer is
                going to ship drivers that only implement the core profile. So in effect, this means
                nothing at all; all OpenGL versions are all effectively backwards compatible.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a name="ftn.d0e997" href="#d0e997" class="para">1</a>] </sup>Deprecation only means marking those functions as to be removed in later
                        functions. They are still available for use in 3.0.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Intro Graphics and Rendering.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Introduction.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Intro Glossary.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Graphics and Rendering&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Glossary</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
