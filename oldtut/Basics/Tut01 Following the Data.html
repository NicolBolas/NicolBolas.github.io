            functioning of the OpenGL pipeline. We will now revisit this pipeline in the context of
            the code in tutorial 1. This will give us an understanding about the specifics of how
            OpenGL goes about rendering data.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1322"></a>Vertex Transfer</h3></div></div></div><p>The first stage in the rasterization pipeline is transforming vertices to clip
                space. Before OpenGL can do this however, it must receive a list of vertices. So the
                very first stage of the pipeline is sending triangle data to OpenGL.</p><p>This is the data that we wish to transfer:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-keyword">const</span> <span class="code-keyword">float</span> vertexPositions[] = {
    <span class="code-number">0.75f</span>, <span class="code-number">0.75f</span>, <span class="code-number">0.0f</span>, <span class="code-number">1.0f</span>,
    <span class="code-number">0.75f</span>, -<span class="code-number">0.75f</span>, <span class="code-number">0.0f</span>, <span class="code-number">1.0f</span>,
    -<span class="code-number">0.75f</span>, -<span class="code-number">0.75f</span>, <span class="code-number">0.0f</span>, <span class="code-number">1.0f</span>,
};</pre><p>Each line of 4 values represents a 4D position of a vertex. These are four
                dimensional because, as you may recall, clip-space is 4D as well. These vertex
                positions are already in clip space. What we want OpenGL to do is render a triangle
                based on this vertex data. Since every 4 floats represents a vertex's position, we
                have 3 vertices: the minimum number for a triangle.</p><p>Even though we have this data, OpenGL cannot use it directly. OpenGL has some
                limitations on what memory it can read from. You can allocate vertex data all you
                want yourself; OpenGL cannot directly see any of your memory. Therefore, the first
                step is to allocate some memory that OpenGL <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> see, and fill
                that memory with our data. This is done with something called a <em class="glossterm">buffer
                    object.</em></p><p>A buffer object is a linear array of memory, managed and allocated by OpenGL at
                the behest of the user. The content of this memory is controlled by the user, but
                the user has only indirect control over it. Think of a buffer object as an array of
                GPU memory. The GPU can read this memory quickly, so storing data in it has
                performance advantages.</p><p>The buffer object in the tutorial was created during initialization. Here is the
                code responsible for creating the buffer object:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e1344"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;1.2.&nbsp;Buffer Object Initialization</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-keyword">void</span> InitializeVertexBuffer()
{
    glGenBuffers(<span class="code-number">1</span>, &amp;positionBufferObject);
    
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, positionBufferObject);
    glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, <span class="code-keyword">sizeof</span>(vertexPositions), vertexPositions, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, <span class="code-number">0</span>);
}</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>The first line creates the buffer object, storing the handle to the object in the
                global variable <code class="varname">positionBufferObject</code>. Though the object now
                exists, it does not own any memory yet. That is because we have not allocated any
                with this object.</p><p>The <code class="function">glBindBuffer</code> function binds the newly-created buffer
                object to the <code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> binding target. As mentioned in
                    <a class="link" href="Intro What is OpenGL.html#OpenGLObjects">the introduction</a>, objects in OpenGL usually
                have to be bound to the context in order for them to do anything, and buffer objects
                are no exception.</p><p>The <code class="function">glBufferData</code> function performs two operations. It
                allocates memory for the buffer currently bound to
                    <code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code>, which is the one we just created and bound.
                We already have some vertex data; the problem is that it is in our memory rather
                than OpenGL's memory. The <code class="literal">sizeof(vertexPositions)</code> uses the C++
                compiler to determine the byte size of the <code class="varname">vertexPositions</code> array.
                We then pass this size to <code class="function">glBufferData</code> as the size of memory to
                allocate for this buffer object. Thus, we allocate enough GPU memory to store our
                vertex data.</p><p>The other operation that <code class="function">glBufferData</code> performs is copying
                data from our memory array into the buffer object. The third parameter controls
                this. If this value is not NULL, as in this case, <code class="function">glBufferData</code>
                will copy the data referenced by the pointer into the buffer object. After this
                function call, the buffer object stores exactly what
                    <code class="varname">vertexPositions</code> stores.</p><p>The fourth parameter is something we will look at in future tutorials.</p><p>The second bind buffer call is simply cleanup. By binding the buffer object 0 to
                    <code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code>, we cause the buffer object previously bound
                to that target to become unbound from it. Zero in this cases works a lot like the
                NULL pointer. This was not strictly necessary, as any later binds to this target
                will simply unbind what is already there. But unless you have very strict control
                over your rendering, it is usually a good idea to unbind the objects you
                bind.</p><p>This is all just to get the vertex data in the GPU's memory. But buffer objects
                are not formatted; as far as OpenGL is concerned, all we did was allocate a buffer
                object and fill it with random binary data. We now need to do something that tells
                OpenGL that there is vertex data in this buffer object and what form that vertex
                data takes.</p><p>We do this in the rendering code. That is the purpose of these lines:</p><pre class="programlisting">glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, positionBufferObject);
glEnableVertexAttribArray(<span class="code-number">0</span>);
glVertexAttribPointer(<span class="code-number">0</span>, <span class="code-number">4</span>, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, <span class="code-number">0</span>, <span class="code-number">0</span>);</pre><p>The first function we have seen before. It simply says that we are going to use
                this buffer object.</p><p>The second function, <code class="function">glEnableVertexAttribArray</code> is something
                we will explain in the next section. Without this function, the next one is
                unimportant.</p><p>The third function is the real key. <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code>,
                despite having the word <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Pointer</span>&#8221;</span> in it, does not deal with pointers.
                Instead, it deals with buffer objects.</p><p>When rendering, OpenGL pulls vertex data from arrays stored in buffer objects. What
                we need to tell OpenGL is what format our vertex array data in the buffer object is
                stored in. That is, we need to tell OpenGL how to interpret the array of data stored
                in the buffer.</p><p>In our case, our data is formatted as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Our position data is stored in 32-bit floating point values using the
                        C/C++ type <span class="type">float</span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Each position is composed of 4 of these values.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>There is no space between each set of 4 values. The values are tightly
                        packed in the array.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The first value in our array of data is at the beginning of the buffer
                        object.</p></li></ul></div><p>The <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code> function tells OpenGL all of this.
                The third parameter specifies the base type of a value. In this case, it is
                    <code class="literal">GL_FLOAT</code>, which corresponds to a 32-bit floating-point value.
                The second parameter specifies how many of these values represent a single piece of
                data. In this case, that is 4. The fifth parameter specifies the spacing between
                each set of values. In our case, there is no space between values, so this value is
                0. And the sixth parameter specifies the byte offset from the  value in the buffer
                object is at the front, which is 0 bytes from the beginning of the buffer
                object.</p><p>The fourth parameter is something that we will look at in later tutorials. The
                first parameter is something we will look at in the next section.</p><p>One thing that appears absent is specifying which buffer object this data comes
                from. This is an implicit association rather than an explicit one.
                    <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code> always refers to whatever buffer is
                bound to <code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> at the time that this function is
                called. Therefore it does not take a buffer object handle; it simply uses the handle
                we bound previously.</p><p>This function will be looked at in greater detail in later tutorials.</p><p>Once OpenGL knows where to get its vertex data from, it can now use that vertex
                data to render.</p><pre class="programlisting">glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, <span class="code-number">0</span>, <span class="code-number">3</span>);</pre><p>This function seems very simple on the surface, but it does a great deal. The
                second and third parameters represent the start index and the number of indices to
                read from our vertex data. The 0th index of the vertex array (defined with
                    <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code>) will be processed, followed by the
                1st and 2nd indices. That is, it starts with the 0th index, and reads 3 vertices
                from the arrays.</p><p>The first parameter to <code class="function">glDrawArrays</code> tells OpenGL that it is
                to take every 3 vertices that it gets as an independent triangle. Thus, it will read
                just 3 vertices and connect them to form a triangle.</p><p>Again, we will go into details in another tutorial.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1477"></a>Vertex Processing and Shaders</h3></div></div></div><p>Now that we can tell OpenGL what the vertex data is, we come to the next stage of
                the pipeline: vertex processing. This is one of two programmable stages that we will
                cover in this tutorial, so this involves the use of a
                <em class="glossterm">shader.</em></p><p>A shader is nothing more than a program that runs on the GPU. There are several
                possible shader stages in the pipeline, and each has its own inputs and outputs. The
                purpose of a shader is to take its inputs, as well as potentially various other
                data, and convert them into a set of outputs.</p><p>Each shader is executed over a set of inputs. It is important to note that a
                shader, of any stage, operates <span class="emphasis"><em>completely independently</em></span> of any
                other shader of that stage. There can be no crosstalk between separate executions of
                a shader. Execution for each set of inputs starts from the beginning of the shader
                and continues to the end. A shader defines what its inputs and outputs are, and it
                is illegal for a shader to complete without writing to all of its outputs (in most
                cases).</p><p>Vertex shaders, as the name implies, operate on vertices. Specifically, each
                invocation of a vertex shader operates on a <span class="emphasis"><em>single</em></span> vertex.
                These shaders must output, among any other user-defined outputs, a clip-space
                position for that vertex. How this clip-space position is computed is entirely up to
                the shader.</p><p>Shaders in OpenGL are written in the OpenGL Shading Language
                    (<acronym class="acronym">GLSL</acronym>). This language looks suspiciously like C, but it is
                very much not C. It has far too many limitations to be C (for example, recursion is
                forbidden). This is what our simple vertex shader looks like:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e1501"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;1.3.&nbsp;Vertex Shader</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">#version <span class="code-number">330</span>

<span class="code-modifier">layout</span>(location = <span class="code-number">0</span>) <span class="code-modifier">in</span> <span class="code-type">vec4</span> position;
<span class="code-type">void</span> main()
{
    gl_Position = position;
}</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>This looks fairly simple. The first line states that the version of GLSL used by
                this shader is version 3.30. A version declaration is required for all GLSL
                shaders.</p><p>The next line defines an input to the vertex shader. The input is a variable named
                    <code class="varname">position</code> and is of type <span class="type">vec4</span>: a 4-dimensional
                vector of floating-point values. It also has a layout location of 0; we'll explain
                that a little later.</p><p>As with C, a shader's execution starts with the <code class="function">main</code>
                function. This shader is very simple, copying the input <code class="varname">position</code>
                into something called <code class="varname">gl_Position</code>. This is a variable that is
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> defined in the shader; that is because it is a standard
                variable defined in every vertex shader. If you see an identifier in a GLSL shader
                that starts with <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">gl_</span>&#8221;</span>, then it must be a built-in identifier. You
                cannot make an identifier that begins with <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">gl_</span>&#8221;</span>; you can only use ones
                that already exist.</p><p><code class="varname">gl_Position</code> is defined as:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-modifier">out</span> <span class="code-type">vec4</span> gl_Position;</pre><p>Recall that the minimum a vertex shader must do is generate a clip-space position
                for the vertex. That is what <code class="varname">gl_Position</code> is: the clip-space
                position of the vertex. Since our input position data is already a clip-space
                position, this shader simply copies it directly into the output.</p><p><b>Vertex Attributes.&nbsp;</b>Shaders have inputs and outputs. Think of these like function parameters and
                    function return values. If the shader is a function, then it is called with
                    input values, and it is expected to return a number of output values.</p><p>Inputs to and outputs from a shader stage come from somewhere and go to somewhere.
                Thus, the input <code class="varname">position</code> in the vertex shader must be filled in
                with data somewhere. So where does that data come from? Inputs to a vertex shader
                are called <em class="glossterm">vertex attributes</em>.</p><p>You might recognize something similar to the term <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">vertex attribute.</span>&#8221;</span>
                For example, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">glEnable<span class="emphasis"><em>VertexAttrib</em></span>Array</span>&#8221;</span> or
                        <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">gl<span class="emphasis"><em>VertexAttrib</em></span>Pointer.</span>&#8221;</span></p><p>This is how data flows down the pipeline in OpenGL. When rendering starts, vertex
                data in a buffer object is read based on setup work done by
                    <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code>. This function describes where the
                data for an attribute comes from. The connection between a particular call to
                    <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code> and the string name of an input value
                to a vertex shader is somewhat complicated.</p><p>Each input to a vertex shader has an index location called an <em class="glossterm">attribute
                    index</em>. The input in this shader was defined with this
                statement:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-modifier">layout</span>(location = <span class="code-number">0</span>) <span class="code-modifier">in</span> <span class="code-type">vec4</span> position;</pre><p>The layout location part assigns the attribute index of 0 to
                    <code class="varname">position</code>. Attribute indices must be greater than or equal to
                zero, and there is a hardware-based limit on the number of attribute indices that
                can be in use at any one time<sup>[<a name="d0e1596" href="#ftn.d0e1596" class="footnote">2</a>]</sup>.</p><p>In code, when referring to attributes, they are <span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span>
                referred to by attribute index. The functions
                    <code class="function">glEnableVertexAttribArray</code>,
                    <code class="function">glDisableVertexAttribArray</code>,  and
                    <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code> all take as their first parameter an
                attribute index. We assigned the attribute index of the <code class="varname">position</code>
                attribute to 0 in the vertex shader, so the call to
                    <code class="function">glEnableVertexAttribArray(0)</code> enables the attribute index
                for the <code class="varname">position</code> attribute.</p><p>Here is a diagram of the data flow to the vertex shader:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e1625"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;1.1.&nbsp;Data Flow to Vertex Shader</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="VertexShaderDataFlow.svg" alt="Data Flow to Vertex Shader"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Without the call to <code class="function">glEnableVertexAttribArray</code>, calling
                    <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code> on that attribute index would not
                mean much. The enable call does not have to be called before the vertex attribute
                pointer call, but it does need to be called before rendering. If the attribute is
                not enabled, it will not be used during rendering.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1639"></a>Rasterization</h3></div></div></div><p>All that has happened thus far is that 3 vertices have been given to OpenGL and it
                has transformed them with a vertex shader into 3 positions in clip-space. Next, the
                vertex positions are transformed into normalized-device coordinates by dividing the
                3 XYZ components of the position by the W component. In our case, W for our 3
                positions was 1.0, so the positions are already effectively in normalized-device
                coordinate space.</p><p>After this, the vertex positions are transformed into window coordinates. This is
                done with something called the <em class="glossterm">viewport transform</em>. This is so
                named because of the function used to set it up, <code class="function">glViewport</code>.
                The tutorial calls this function every time the window's size changes. Remember that
                the framework calls <code class="function">reshape</code> whenever the window's size changes.
                So the tutorial's implementation of reshape is this:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e1655"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;1.4.&nbsp;Reshaping Window</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-keyword">void</span> reshape (<span class="code-keyword">int</span> w, <span class="code-keyword">int</span> h)

    glViewport(<span class="code-number">0</span>, <span class="code-number">0</span>, (GLsizei) w, (GLsizei) h);
}</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>This tells OpenGL what area of the available area we are rendering to. In this
                case, we change it to match the full available area. Without this function call,
                resizing the window would have no effect on the rendering. Also, make note of the
                fact that we make no effort to keep the aspect ratio constant; shrinking or
                stretching the window in a direction will cause the triangle to shrink and stretch
                to match.</p><p>Recall that window coordinates are in a lower-left coordinate system. So the point
                (0, 0) is the bottom left of the window. This function takes the bottom left
                position as the first two coordinates, and the width and height of the viewport
                rectangle as the other two coordinates.</p><p>Once in window coordinates, OpenGL can now take these 3 vertices and scan-convert
                it into a series of fragments. In order to do this however, OpenGL must decide what
                the list of vertices represents.</p><p>OpenGL can interpret a list of vertices in a variety of different ways. The way
                OpenGL interprets vertex lists is given by the draw command:</p><pre class="programlisting">glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, <span class="code-number">0</span>, <span class="code-number">3</span>);</pre><p>The enum <code class="literal">GL_TRIANGLES</code> tells OpenGL that every 3 vertices of the
                list should be used to build a triangle. Since we passed only 3 vertices, we get 1
                triangle.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e1675"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;1.2.&nbsp;Data Flow to Rasterizer</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="RasterizerDataFlow.svg" alt="Data Flow to Rasterizer"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>If we rendered 6 vertices, then we would get 2 triangles.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1683"></a>Fragment Processing</h3></div></div></div><p>A fragment shader is used to compute the output color(s) of a fragment. The inputs
                of a fragment shader include the window-space XYZ position of the fragment. It can
                also include user-defined data, but we will get to that in later tutorials.</p><p>Our fragment shader looks like this:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e1690"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;1.5.&nbsp;Fragment Shader</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">#version <span class="code-number">330</span>

<span class="code-type">void</span> main()
{
   outputColor = <span class="code-type">vec4</span>(<span class="code-number">1.0f</span>, <span class="code-number">1.0f</span>, <span class="code-number">1.0f</span>, <span class="code-number">1.0f</span>);
}</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>As with the vertex shader, the first line states that the shader uses GLSL version
                3.30.</p><p>The next line specifies an output for the fragment shader. The output variable is
                of type <span class="type">vec4</span>.</p><p>The main function simply sets the output color to a 4-dimensional vector, with all
                of the components as 1.0f. This sets the Red, Green, and Blue components of the
                color to full intensity, which is 1.0; this creates the white color of the triangle.
                The fourth component is something we will see in later tutorials.</p><p>Though all fragment shaders are provided the window-space position of the
                fragment, this one does not need it. So it simply does not use it.</p><p>After the fragment shader executes, the fragment output color is written to the
                output image.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>In the section on vertex shaders, we had to use the <code class="literal">layout(location =
                        #)</code> syntax in order to provide a connection between a vertex shader
                    input and a vertex attribute index. This was required in order for the user to
                    connect a vertex array to a vertex shader input. So you may be wondering where
                    the connection between the fragment shader output and the screen comes
                    in.</p><p>OpenGL recognizes that, in a lot of rendering, there is only one logical place
                    for a fragment shader output to go: the current image being rendered to (in our
                    case, the screen). Because of that, if you define only one output from a
                    fragment shader, then this output value will automatically be written to the
                    current destination image. It is possible to have multiple fragment shader
                    outputs that go to multiple different destination images; this adds some
                    complexity, similar to attribute indices. But that is for another time.</p></div></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a name="ftn.d0e1596" href="#d0e1596" class="para">2</a>] </sup>For virtually all hardware since the beginning of commercial programmable
