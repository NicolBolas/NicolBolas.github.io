            programmable ones? We have seen that, even in the humble TNT days, there were a couple
            of user-defined opcodes with several possible input values.</p><p>One way is to consider what programming is. Programming is not simply a mathematical
            operation; programming needs conditional logic. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to say
            that something is not truly programmable until there is the possibility of some form of
            conditional logic.</p><p>And it is at this point where that first truly appears. It appears first in the
                <span class="emphasis"><em>vertex</em></span> pipeline rather than the fragment pipeline. This seems
            odd until one realizes how crucial fragment operations are to overall performance. It
            therefore makes sense to introduce heavy programmability in the less
            performance-critical areas of hardware first.</p><p>The GeForce 3, released in 2001 (a mere 3 years after the TNT), was the first hardware
            to provide this level of programmability. While GeForce 3 hardware did indeed have the
            fixed-function vertex pipeline, it also had very flexible programmable pipeline. The
            retaining of the fixed-function code was a performance need; the vertex shader was not
            as fast as the fixed-function one. It should be noted that the original X-Box's GPU,
            designed in tandem with the GeForce 3, eschewed the fixed-functionality altogether in
            favor of having multiple vertex shaders that could compute several vertices at a time.
            This was eventually adopted for later GeForces.</p><p>Vertex shaders were pretty powerful, even in their first incarnation. While there was
            no conditional branching, there was conditional logic, the equivalent of the ?:
            operator. These vertex shaders exposed up to 128 <span class="type">vec4</span> uniforms, up to 16
                <span class="type">vec4</span> inputs (still the modern limit), and could output 6
                <span class="type">vec4</span> outputs. Two of the outputs, intended for colors, were lower
            precisions than the others. There was a hard limit of 128 opcodes. These vertex shaders
            brought full swizzling support and a plethora of math operations.</p><p>The GeForce 3 also added up to two more textures, for a total of four textures per
            triangle. They were hooked directly into certain per-vertex outputs, because the
            per-fragment pipeline did not have real programmability yet.</p><p>At this point, the holy grail of programmability at the fragment level was dependent
            texture access. That is, being able to access a texture, do some arbitrary computations
            on it, and then access another texture with the result. The GeForce 3 had some
            facilities for that, but they were not very good ones.</p><p>The GeForce 3 used 8 register combiner stages instead of the 2 that the earlier cards
            used. Their register files were extended to support two extra texture colors and a few
            more tricks. But the main change was something that, in OpenGL terminology, would be
            called <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">texture shaders.</span>&#8221;</span></p><p>What texture shaders did was allow the user to, instead of accessing a texture,
            perform a computation on that texture's texture unit. This was much like the old texture
            environment functionality, except only for texture coordinates. The textures were
            arranged in a sequence. And instead of accessing a texture, you could perform a
            computation between that texture unit's coordinate and possibly the coordinate from the
            previous texture shader operation, if there was one.</p><p>It was not very flexible functionality. It did allow for full texture-space bump
            mapping, though. While the 8 register combiners were enough to do a full matrix
            multiply, they were not powerful enough to normalize the resulting vector. However, you
            could normalize a vector by accessing a special cubemap. The values of this cubemap
            represented a normalized vector in the direction of the cubemap's given texture
            coordinate.</p><p>But using that required spending a total of 3 texture shader stages. Which meant you
            get a bump map and a normalization cubemap only; there was no room for a diffuse map in
            that pass. It also did not perform very well; the texture shader functions were quite
            expensive.</p><p>True programmability came to the fragment shader from ATI, with the Radeon 8500,
            released in late 2001.</p><p>The 8500's fragment shader architecture was pretty straightforward, and in terms of
            programming, it is not too dissimilar to modern shader systems. Texture coordinates
            would come in. They could either be used to fetch from a texture or be given directly as
            inputs to the processing stage. Up to 6 textures could be used at once. Then, up to 8
            opcodes, including a conditional operation, could be used. After that, the hardware
            would repeat the process using registers written by the opcodes. Those registers could
            feed texture accesses from the same group of textures used in the first pass. And then
            another 8 opcodes would generate the output color.</p><p>It also had strong, but not full, swizzling support in the fragment shader. Register
            combiners had very little support for swizzling.</p><p>This era of hardware was also the first to allow 3D textures. Though that was as much
            a memory concern as anything else, since 3D textures take up lots of memory which was
            not available on earlier cards. Depth comparison texturing was also made
            available.</p><p>While the 8500 was a technological marvel, it was a flop in the market compared to the
            GeForce 3 &amp; 4. Indeed, this is a recurring theme of these eras: the card with the
            more programmable hardware often tends to lose in its first iteration.</p><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>API Hell</b></p><p>This era is notable in what it did to graphics APIs. Consider the hardware
                differences between the 8500 and the GeForce 3/4 in terms of fragment
                processing.</p><p>On the Direct3D front, things were not the best. Direct3D 8 promised a unified
                shader development pipeline. That is, you could write a shader according to their
                specifications and it would work on any D3D 8 hardware. And this was effectively
                true. For vertex shaders, at least.</p><p>However, the D3D 8.0 pixel shader pipeline was nothing more than NVIDIA's register
                combiners and texture shaders. There was no real abstraction of capabilities; the
                D3D 8.0 pixel shaders simply took NVIDIA's hardware and made a shader language out
                of it.</p><p>To provide support for the 8500's expanded fragment processing feature-set, there
                was D3D 8.1. This version altered the pixel shader pipeline to match the
                capabilities of the Radeon 8500. Fortunately, the 8500 would accept 8.0 shaders just
                fine, since it was capable of doing everything the GeForce 3 could do. But no one
                would mistake either shader specification for any kind of real abstraction.</p><p>Things were much worse on the OpenGL front. At least in D3D, you used the same
                basic C++ API to provide shaders; the shaders themselves may have been different,
                but the base API was the same. Not so in OpenGL land.</p><p>NVIDIA and ATI released entirely separate proprietary extensions for specifying
                fragment shaders. NVIDIA's extensions built on the register combiner extension they
                released with the GeForce 256. They were completely incompatible. And worse, they
                were not even string-based.</p><p>Imagine having to call a C++ function to write every opcode of a shader. Now
                imagine having to call <span class="emphasis"><em>three</em></span> functions to write each opcode.
                That's what using those APIs was like.</p><p>Things were better on vertex shaders. NVIDIA initially released a vertex shader
                extension, as did ATI. NVIDIA's was string-based, but ATI's version was like their
                fragment shader. Fortunately, this state of affairs did not last long; the OpenGL
                ARB came along with their own vertex shader extension. This was not GLSL, but an
                assembly like language based on NVIDIA's extension.</p><p>It would take much longer for the fragment shader disparity to be worked
                out.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="History GeForce.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="History of Graphics Hardware.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="History GeForceFX.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Vertices and Registers&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Dependency</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
