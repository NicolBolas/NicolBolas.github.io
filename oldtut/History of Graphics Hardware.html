        formative years of the development of consumer graphics hardware, what follows is a brief
        history. Hopefully, it will give you some perspective on what has changed in the last 15
        years or so, as well as an idea of how grateful you should be that you never had to suffer
        through the early days.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e16817"></a>Voodoo Magic</h2></div></div></div><p>In the years 1995 and 1996, a number of graphics cards were released. Graphics
            processing via specialized hardware on PC platforms was nothing new. What was new about
            these cards was their ability to do 3D rasterization.</p><p>The most popular of these for that era was the Voodoo Graphics card from 3Dfx
            Interactive. It was fast, powerful for its day, and provided high quality rendering
            (again, for its day).</p><p>The functionality of this card was quite bare-bones from a modern perspective.
            Obviously there was no concept of shaders of any kind. Indeed, it did not even have
            vertex transformation; the Voodoo Graphics pipeline began with clip-space values. This
            required the CPU to do vertex transformations. This hardware was effectively just a
            triangle rasterizer.</p><p>That being said, it was quite good for its day. As inputs to its rasterization
            pipeline, it took vertex inputs of a 4-dimensional clip-space position (though the
            actual space was not necessarily the same as OpenGL's clip-space), a single RGBA color,
            and a single three-dimensional texture coordinate. The hardware did not support 3D
            textures; the extra component was in case the user wanted to do projective
            texturing.</p><p>The texture coordinate was used to map into a single texture. The texture coordinate
            and color interpolation was perspective-correct; in those days, that was a significant
            selling point. The venerable Playstation 1 could not do perspective-correct
            interpolation.</p><p>The value fetched from the texture could be combined with the interpolated color using
            one of three math functions: additions, multiplication, or linear interpolation based on
            the texture's alpha value. The alpha of the output was controlled with a separate math
            function, thus allowing the user to generate the alpha with different math than the RGB
            portion of the output color. This was the sum total of its fragment processing.</p><p>It had framebuffer blending support. Its framebuffer could even support a
            destination alpha value, though you had to give up having a depth buffer to get it.
            Probably not a good tradeoff. Outside of that issue, its blending support was superior
            even to OpenGL 1.1. It could use different source and destination factors for the alpha
            component than the RGB component; the old GL 1.1 forced the RGB and A to be blended with
            the same factors.</p><p>The blending was even performed with full 24-bit color precision and then downsampled
            to the 16-bit precision of the output upon writing.</p><p>From a modern perspective, spoiled with our full programmability, this all looks
            incredibly primitive. And, to some degree, it is. But compared to the pure CPU solutions
            to 3D rendering of the day, the Voodoo Graphics card was a monster.</p><p>It's interesting to note that the simplicity of the fragment processing stage owes as
            much to the lack of inputs as anything else. When the only values you have to work with
            are the color from a texture lookup and the per-vertex interpolated color, there really
            is not all that much you could do with them. Indeed, as we will see in the next phases of
            hardware, increases in the complexity of the fragment processor was a reaction to
            increasing the number of inputs <span class="emphasis"><em>to</em></span> the fragment processor. When you
            have more data to work with, you need more complex operations to make that data
            useful.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="apa.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center">&nbsp;</td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="History TNT.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Appendix&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Further Study&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Dynamite Combiners</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
